   abstract = {The paper aims at developing a simple two-step homogenization scheme for prediction of elastic properties of a high performance concrete (HPC) in which microstructural heterogeneities are distinguished with the help of nanoindentation. The main components of the analyzed material include blended cement, fly-ash and fine aggregate. The material heterogeneity appears on several length scales as well as porosity that is accounted for in the model. Grid nanoindentation is applied as a fundamental source of elastic properties of individual microstructural phases in which subsequent statistical evaluation and deconvolution of phase properties are employed. The multilevel porosity is evaluated from combined sources, namely mercury intrusion porosimetry and optical image analyses. Micromechanical data serve as input parameters for analytical (Mori-Tanaka) and numerical FFT-based elastic homogenizations at microscale. Both schemes give similar results and justify the isotropic character of the material. The elastic stiffness matrices are derived from individual phase properties and directly from the grid nanoindentation data with very good agreement. The second material level, which accounts for large air porosity and aggregate, is treated with analytical homogenization to predict the overall composite properties. The results are compared with macroscopic experimental measurements received from static and dynamic tests. Also here, good agreement was achieved within the experimental error, which includes microscale phase interactions in a very dense heterogeneous composite matrix. The methodology applied in this paper gives promising results for the better prediction of HPC elastic properties and for further reduction of expensive experimental works that must be, otherwise, performed on macroscopic level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Advances in engineering the microstructure of cementitious composites have led to the development of fiber reinforced Ultra High Performance Concretes (UHPC). The scope of this paper is twofold, first to characterize the nano-mechanical properties of the phases governing the UHPC microstructure by means of a novel statistical nanoindentation technique; then to upscale those nanoscale properties, by means of continuum micromechanics, to the macroscopic scale of engineering applications. In particular, a combined investigation of nanoindentation, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) indicates that the fiber-matrix transition zone is relatively defect free. On this basis, a four-level multiscale model with defect free interfaces allows to accurately determine the composite stiffness from the measured nano-mechanical properties. Besides evidencing the dominant role of high density calcium silicate hydrates and the stiffening effect of residual clinker, the suggested model may become a useful tool for further optimizing cement-based engineered composites. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The rate of the logarithmic creep is found to scale in a unique manner with indentation modulus, indentation hardness, and packing density, independent of processing, mix proportions, indenter geometry and load history. The comparison with macroscopic creep experiments on concrete shows that minutes-long nanoindentations enable a quantitative assessment of the long-term creep properties of cementitious materials, orders of magnitude faster than macroscopic testing. Finally, we show that a strong analogy exists between this logarithmic creep behavior of C-S-H and that of soils, which suggests a granular origin of creep of geomaterials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The micromechanical properties of Portland cement paste were investigated by the coupled nanoindentation and scanning electron microscope method. The mechanical parameters (e.g. indentation modulus and hardness) of individual active phases present in Portland cement paste were estimated by the proposed method. From the mechanical parameters of Portland cement paste at the micro-scale, the evolution of elastic modulus of Portland cement paste at the macro-scale was predicted by a homogenization method and the geometries of the main constituents in Portland cement paste were taken into account.

This work is designed to provide an insight into the critical aspects, including the influences of material microstructure and statistical analysis method. Firstly, the microstructure of hardened cement pastes was investigated by SEM-BSE/EDX analysis. Then, the influence of heterogeneous material microstructure on the nanoindentation results was investigated through a micromechanical method. After that, two general methods of parameter estimation were applied to analyze the nanoindentation data and global optimal results were sought by multiple runs with the random starting values. This work revealed that the indented 'Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate' microstructure is a fact of the composites and the analysis result largely depends on the selected statistical analysis method. The influences of material microstructure and statistical analysis method may cause unreliable result.

The ITZ with high proportion of N-C-A-S-H and C-A-S-H gels tends to have high elastic modulus because of their superior micromechanical properties. The formation of reaction products would refine the microstructure of ITZ and improve its elastic modulus. The evolution of micromechanical properties of ITZ can be divided into three stages: (i) accelerated growth stage via fast chemical reactions (<12 h); (ii) stationary stage via stable chemical reactions (12 h-7 d); (iii) decrement stage via microcrack propagation (7 d-28 d).

Results indicate that the formation of original ITZ depends on the so-called “wall effect”, leading to a deficit of large grains and a higher effective alkaline activator/precursor ratio compared to paste matrix. The alkaline reaction process is correspondingly accelerated, which promotes the formation of low Ca C-(N)-A-S-H gels and reduces the porosity in the ITZ. Afterwards, the high Ca C-(N)-A-S-H gels are generated due to the release of more Ca from slag, resulting in the continuous refinement of pores. The C-(N)-A-S-H gels with rich Si and Al are then produced at 7 d, attributing to the species diffusion from paste matrix to ITZ. Consequently, a compact and dense microstructure is formed in the ITZ at 28 d, which would be beneficial to the long-term performance of concrete.},

While both the rate and the magnitude of autogenous shrinkage for almost all mixtures were increased with rise of curing temperature, extents of the influence were varied with water-binder ratio, composition of cementitious materials and age. It is noted that although the equivalent age equation was widely applied to evaluate temperature dependence of mechanical properties of cement-based materials, its applicability on autogenous shrinkage of HPC was questionable.

Three micromechanical models from three research groups have been adopted for modeling the basic non-aging creep of cementitious materials. The benchmark is based on the hypotheses that creep results only from calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) and that viscoelastic behavior of all microstructural constituents is maturity- and composition-independent. By comparing model results among themselves as well as by comparing model predictions with experimental results obtained from three different laboratories, we demonstrate that creep upscaling from micrometer-sized C-S-H to centimeter-sized macroscopic samples of cement paste, mortar, and concrete, and from minutes-long creep tests at early ages to days-long creep tests at very mature ages is indeed possible. The benchmark also highlights the importance of considering micro-anisotropy of C-S-H in terms of non-spherical shapes for C-S-H hydrates.},

The non-logarithmic transient periods lasted for days at the macroscopic scale, but only for seconds at the scale of microindentation. The creep moduli (which thus govern the rate of the long-term logarithmic creep) of concrete samples were estimated from microindentations performed at the scale of cement pastes in combination with micro-mechanical models. Those estimates were proportional to the creep moduli measured on concrete samples by regular macroscopic uniaxial testing, thus proving that minutes-long microindentation can provide a measurement of the long-term creep properties of cementitious materials. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

It was found that thermal deformation dominates early-age stress development in low w/cm and low slag cement paste systems. While for concrete, autogenous shrinkage is the major contributing factor for tensile stress development. The early-age stress development of uniaxially restrained cementitious mixture specimens is profoundly influenced by the overt early-age relaxation effect, such that the compressive stress is significantly reduced and tensile stress develops before shrinkage begins. A linear shrinkage and tensile stress relationship is found to exist in mixtures subject to such constant restraint, regardless of w/cm and slag cement contents. Slag cement has the benefit of delaying tensile stress development and cracking time because of the reduced early-age thermal effect as compared to the ordinary Portland cement mixture. The cracking of the slag cement mixture is mainly due to the greater long-term autogenous shrinkage. The cracking time is found closely related to the shrinkage rate rather than the shrinkage magnitude, a unique relationship can be used to describe such phenomenon.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The loading applied at the concrete level, is first concentrated (“downscaled”) to maximum stresses related to cement paste volumes which are directly adjacent to the aggregates, i.e. to the interfacial transition zones (ITZ). These maximum stresses are further “downscaled” to the micron-sized hydrates, in terms of higher-order stress averages. The latter enter a Drucker-Prager failure criterion with material constants derived from nanoindentation tests. The model is successfully validated across the hydrate-to-concrete scales.

To investigate possible size effect on compressive strength and failure mechanism of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates (C-S-H) in cement paste, micropillar compression experiments were performed on micropillar geometries fabricated by focused ion beam milling on potential C-S-H locations identified through coupled backscatter electron imaging (BSE) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The compressive strength of C-S-H (181–1145 MPa) measured from C-S-H micropillars of varying diameters indicated presence of a size effect with strong increase in strength with decreasing diameter. The deformation mode at failure also exhibited size effect: the dominant failure mode changed from axial splitting to plastic crushing as the pillar diameter was decreased. The observed relationship between strength and pillar diameter can be modeled by an inverse square root dependency which closely corresponds to Bazant's scaling law of quasi-brittle failure.},

To compete with conventional concrete, a better understanding of low-cement concrete is needed regarding both microstructural features responsible for mechanical performance and key parameters for robust mix design. In particular, this paper aims at disclosing the microstructure of cementitious systems in which up to 60% of Portland cement has been replaced with natural pozzolan (NP), without significantly affecting the 90-day mechanical strength and stiffness (using a fixed water-to-binder ratio of 0.35).

A library of aggregates characterised with five shape indices is then built and subsequently used with a “greedy search” bin packing algorithm to generate meso-models of concrete according to specified volume fraction and size gradation. To build concrete models with high compactness, for example, with 40–60% contents of aggregates, the Bullet physics engine, based on a hard-contact discrete element method, is further applied to simulate the complicated compaction and vibration process in real casting procedures. The developed framework provides a promising basis for further mesoscale studies, such as 3D printing, multiscale homogenization, damage and fracture mechanisms, and environmental factors-induced degradation.},

First of all, the contact creep modulus of the paste was obtained by the microindentation test, and the contact creep moduli of the individual phases in the paste were obtained by the nanoindentation test. Secondly, the volume fractions of individual phases were determined by micro test and statistical processing. Then, the contact creep modulus of the paste was calculated with the homogenization method of multiple scales and compared with the creep modulus of the paste measured by microindentation. Finally, the effect of pores, C-S-H, and unhydrated clinker (UC) on the creep modulus of the paste was quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that when the contact creep modulus of the pore was regarded as 0 GPa, the contact creep modulus of the paste was significantly underestimated. The effective contact creep modulus of the pore should be used for the homogenization calculation. The C-S-H gel with low density (LD) and C-S-H gel with high density (HD) had opposite effects on the modulus of creep of the paste so that those two gels needed to be treated separately during the homogenization process. The variation range of the contact creep modulus of UC was relatively large with slight effect on the homogenized contact creep modulus of the paste. Consequently, it can be treated as single-phase in the homogenization calculation.},

Subsequently the Stage-2 proposes a multi-scale model (in three hierarchical levels) initiating from C–S–H matrix considering the formation of two types of C–S–H (low- and high-density C–S–H) to cement paste for the computation of the intrinsic mechanical properties of cement paste. As the volume fraction of C–S–H and capillary porosity are the most significant components which determines the mechanical properties of cement paste, prime consideration herein is given to C–S–H space ratio.

The relationships provide a direct conversion of well-known Euler-Bernoulli solutions to that of Timoshenko solutions without further need for a more complicated shear deformable analysis. They should be useful to engineers designing shear deformable beam constructed from viscoelastic materials or exhibiting viscoelastic behavior. Further, they provide valuable exact solutions for checking the validity, convergence, and accuracy of numerical results and software for the bending analysis of linear viscoelastic Timoshenko beams. where tV =bending rotation, and k = shear correction factor that is dependent on the shape of the cross section. According to the Tirnoshenko beam theory and considering viscoelasticity, the stress-resultant-displacement relations can be given by dependent load q(x, t) in which x is the longitudinal coordinate of the beam and t is the time. Assuming the Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis of plane sections remaining plane, the stress-resultant-displacement relations for a viscoelastic beam may be expressed as where M =bending moment; V = shear force; w = transverse deflection; prime (') denotes partial derivative with respect to the longitudinal coordinate x; subscript E denotes the quantities belonging to the Euler-Bernoulli beam; and the Stieltjes' convolution notation (Gurtin and Sternberg 1962) implies the following: !(t) *dg(t) =!(t)g(O) + ('.' !(t-,) dgm (3) J~ (I) (2) (4) (5) ME(x, t) =-IE(t)*d(w~) VE(x, t) =-IE(t) * d(w';:) Mr(x, t) =-IE(t)*d(IjJ') Vr(x, t) =-kAG(t)*d(1jJ-w~) GOVERNING BENDING EQUATIONS Considering the balance of a beam element dx for both Eu-ler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams, one obtains M'(x, t) =V(x, t); V'(x, t) =-q(x, t) (6,7) Substituting (2) and (6) into (7) yields the governing bending equations for the viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam IE(t)*d(w';:') =-M~ =q(x, t) (8) By substituting (4) and (5) into (6) and (7), the equilibrium equations of the viscoelastic Timoshenko beam can be written as STRESS-DISPLACEMENT RELATIONS Consider a linear viscoelastic beam of length L, cross-sectional area A, second moment of area I, modulus function E(t), shear modulus function G(t) under general transverse time-The Euler-Bernoulli (or classical) beam theory is well-known. Engineers are very familiar with the determination of the stress resultants and deflections of elastic beams based on this theory. However, the setback of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is that it neglects the effect of transverse shear deformation and thus produces inaccurate bending solutions for deep beams or shear deformable beams such as those made of sandwich construction. Recently, Wang (1995) derived simple exact relationships linking these Euler-Bernoulli bending solutions to Timoshenko solutions. Thus, the effect of transverse shear deformation in the beams may be accounted for without the need for a more complicated shear deformable beam analysis , as the relationships yield directly the Timoshenko beam solutions based on the Euler-Bernoulli solutions. As an extension of the aforementioned work, this technical note presents exact linking relationships between viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam solutions and viscoelastic Timoshenko beam solutions. So far, only a few studies have been made on viscoelastic Timoshenko beams. Huang (1977) treated such beams under traveling loads. Chen (1995) proposed a hybrid Laplace transform/finite-element method for the quasi-static and dynamic analysis of viscoelastic Timoshenko beams. Thus, this study provides important information to engineering designers dealing with shear deformable beams with visco-elastic behavior. The relationships presented herein can be used directly to furnish the viscoelastic Timoshenko beam bending solutions from the more familiar viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam solutions such as those found in Flilgge (1975), Yagawa et al. (1977), Chen and Lin (1982), and Rencis et al. (1990). Moreover, the relationships provide researchers with valuable exact solutions for checking the validity, convergence , and accuracy of numerical solutions.},

The morphological model refers to two types of C-S-H (calcium silicate hydrates, main hydration products of Portland cements) distinguished by many authors: inner products or high density C-S-H build up layers surrounding the anhydrous particles, while the outer products or low density C-S-H play the role of a porous matrix. The simulations of the effective Young's modulus at late age during hydration and at the end of hydration prove to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results available in the literature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The response of hydrating cement paste through setting are monitored using rheological measurements and ultrasonic reflection measurements. Increases in the elastic modulus and yield stress of cement paste with time are obtained from the rheological measurements. Ultrasonic measurements are performed using horizontally polarized shear waves (SH) reflected off of the hydrating cement paste. Changes in the ultrasonic signal through setting are related with changes in the porosity and stiffness of an equivalent water-filled poroelastic material, which provides identical acoustic impedance. The measured changes in the shear modulus obtained from ultrasonic measurement are shown to correlate well with increase in elastic modulus obtained from rheological measurements. The increase in the shear modulus of the porous material obtained from the ultrasonic measurements is shown to correspond well with the observed increase in the yield stress of the cement paste. By combining the information from rheological and ultrasonic measurements, it is found that even in the fluid stage there is sufficient structural integrity in the arrangement of cement grains to support low-amplitude shear stress and the evolution of a continuously connected network of cement particles within the paste is coincident with a rapid increase in the shear modulus of the porous skeleton. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The analyzed surface was previously prepared using focussed ion beam milling. The same surface was also characterized by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate the capability of this quantitative nanomechanical mapping to provide information on the local distribution of the elastic modulus (from about 1 to about 100 GPa) with a spatial resolution in the range of decananometers, that corresponds to that of low-keV back-scattered electron imaging. Despite some surface roughness which affects the measured nanomechanical properties it is shown that topography, adhesion and Young's modulus can be clearly distinguished. The quantitative mapping of the local elastic modulus is able to discriminate between phases in the cement paste microstructure that cannot be distinguished from the corresponding back-scattered electron images. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Basic creep in compression is significantly more important than basic creep in tension. This difference increases with decreasing concrete age at loading. Compression creep and tension creep are similar under drying conditions. Analysis of these results provides insight into the physical mechanism underlying basic creep in concrete: microcrack initiation generates additional strains related to the development of additional self-drying shrinkage. We thus propose that basic creep in concrete is mainly caused by additional self-drying shrinkage under stress. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Beam elements with three degrees of freedom per node, and with a random orientation of the beams within the lattice, gave the best comparison with experiment. The effect of element resolution on fracture results was also investigated. A new fracture law has been developed that uses principal tensile stresses in each node of the lattice to determine which beam should break at every step of a simulation. For the implementation of heterogeneity in the model, a method has been developed that uses digital images of the real microstructure of a material. Simulated crack patterns were obtained for a real material , using this technique, which appear quite realistic. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Common, high and ultra high performance concretes undergo autogenous deformation (AD) when hardening. Deformations are often measured in specimens cured in so-called autogenous conditions, where fully coupled thermal deformation (TD) and AD are the only deformations. Therefore, in autogenous conditions, a decoupling technique must be used to separate the contributions of TD and AD. This paper presents a new technique using optical fiber sensors in specimens that are cured at varying temperatures and in autogenous conditions. Degree of reaction indexes (DRI), sometimes called maturity and equivalent time, are employed to separate TD and AD. The paper begins with a summary of the application of DRI to decoupling techniques, with particular focus on theoretical limits and potential for deformation separation. Current practices related to decoupling and modeling of the thermal and autogenous deformation are evaluated through comparison with experiments. Results confirm that testing improves the accuracy of estimation of values for the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC). Moreover, since AD swelling is detected for all tests, models that include the assumption that AD is exclusively shrinkage are not appropriate for describing AD at varying temperatures. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The performance of MOGP is illustrated by modeling a complex civil engineering problem: the time-dependent total creep of concrete. A Big Data is used for the model development so that the proposed concrete creep model—referred to as a “genetic programming based creep model” or “G-C model” in this study—is valid for both normal and high strength concrete with a wide range of structural properties. The G-C model is then compared with currently accepted creep prediction models. The G-C model obtained by MOGP is simple, straightforward to use, and provides more accurate predictions than other prediction models.},

   abstract = {The authors investigated a technique to inhibit subsequent prestress loss in a concrete beam by effective creep induction at an early age, and examined the structural performances of beams with the creep at an early age. Consistent experimental results suggested that a more progressive creep induced by a higher first prestressing force or under an elevated temperature (45 °C) at an early age was likely to reduce the prestress loss after another prestressing at seven days of age. The creep tended to increase the compressive strength and Young's modulus of the concrete, and the tensile strength was not decreased when the sustained stress was within the elastic range. The flexural behaviour of a prestressed concrete beam with the creep at an early age was observed to be almost the same as that of a beam without the creep, although the maximum flexural crack width was slightly increased by the early age creep. It was found that the shear crack propagation was more progressive when the creep was significantly accelerated at an early age under severe conditions that applied a high sustained stress beyond the elastic range or at the elevated temperature. It was thus concluded that a larger creep induction at an early age impeded subsequent prestress loss in concrete beams more significantly, although its acceleration under the above severe conditions may lead to reduction of the structural performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This low w/c ratio can offer high strength and low permeability, however, coming with other drawbacks, such as high self-desiccation and high temperature rise, both of which can increase the early-age cracking potential of concrete. Creep is important to evaluate the early-age cracking resistance of concrete. Although studies on the influence of w/c ratio on the creep of mature concrete have been conducted, investigations on the influence of w/c ratio on the early-age tensile creep remain lacking. Therefore, investigations on the influence of w/c ratio on the tensile creep and cracking resistance of early-age concrete must be conducted. Experimental studies on the influence of w/c ratio (0.33, 0.40, and 0.50) on the temperature change, autogenous shrinkage, restrained stress, tensile creep, and cracking resistance of early-age concrete under adiabatic condition and at full restraint degree were conducted using Temperature Stress Test Machine. The test results indicate that (1) the temperature rise under adiabatic condition increased by 32.6%, and 74.2% when w/c ratio decreased from 0.50 to 0.40, and 0.33, respectively; (2) the restrained tensile stress rate under adiabatic condition and at full restraint degree increased by 16.7%, and 33.3% when w/c ratio decreased from 0.50 to 0.40, and 0.33, respectively; (3) the early-age specific basic tensile creep and basic tensile creep/shrinkage under adiabatic condition and at full restraint degree increased with the decrease of w/c ratio; (4) the early-age cracking potential under adiabatic condition and at full restraint degree increased with the decrease of w/c ratio according to the integrated criterion.},

Continuous non-destructive testing constitutes a major opportunity since it generally consists in simple test setup requiring low human interaction.

Indeed, these two additions present interesting complementary effects and positive synergies in terms of fresh properties, mechanical behaviour and durability potential. The hydration process of these concretes is investigated, and a new model is presented for representing the hydration degree of SCM-based binders.

Concrete is made from numerous ingredients that have huge variability either at the design stage or at the testing stage. The main goal of this paper is to quantify the anomalies and outliers during the design phase of concrete mixtures. Concrete mixtures have various percentages of ingredients such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, fine and coarse aggregates. Machine learning and data mining is considered a very thriving topic in many research fields and its implementation in the construction industry still limited. Concrete community is in need for such a tool to produce an efficient way to efficiently design concrete mixtures. Outliers could occur during the evaluation of samples’ measurements that might include human or system errors. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is the most common method used to determine outliers, however, the LOF has some challenges. In this paper, an anomaly-based outlier detection algorithm called Isolation Forest based on a Sliding window for the Local Outlier Factor (IFS-LOF) algorithm, is proposed to solve the limitations of the LOF in evaluating 1030 concrete mixtures. The proposed algorithm works without any previous knowledge of data distribution and executes the process within limited memory and with minimal computational effort. The evaluation of results proved that the IFS-LOF algorithm is more efficient in detecting the sequence of outliers and provided more efficient accuracy that other state of the art LOF algorithms.},

   abstract = {© 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. Customary micromechanics models for the poroelasticity, creep, and strength of concrete restrict the domain affected by the hydration reaction to the cement paste volume, considering the latter as a thermodynamically closed system with respect to the (chemically inert) aggregate. Accordingly, the famous Powers hydration model appears to be a natural choice for the determination of clinker, cement, water, and aggregate volume fractions entering such micromechanical models. The situation changes once internal curing occurs, i.e., once part of the water present is absorbed initially by the aggregate, and then is sucked back to the cement paste during the hydration reaction. This paper develops an extended hydration model for this case, introducing water uptake capacity of the aggregate and paste void-filling extent as additional quantities. Based on constant values for just these two new quantities, and on previously determined creep properties of cement pastes as functions of an effective water:cement mass ratio (i.e., that associated with the cement paste domain rather than with the entire concrete volume), a series of ultrashort-term creep tests on different mortars and concretes can be very satisfactorily predicted by a standard microviscoelastic mathematical model. This further extends the applicability range of micromechanics modeling in cement and concrete research.},

In order to assess the effect of the evolving microstructure on creep, the so-called equivalent systems are employed. In these systems, part of the otherwise unhydrated cement is replaced with inert filler (quartz powder). With this approach, non-aging systems are obtained that can emulate specific microstructural features of the real hydrating systems. Despite the very similar elastic Young's moduli of the real and their corresponding equivalent systems, the real hydrating systems experienced much higher creep in the first weeks after loading than the equivalent, inert systems. The differences in creep could be explained either by possibly different morphologies of the hydrates in the two types of systems, intrinsic aging or with the active role of the hydration process in increasing creep (dissolution theory of creep).},

These acoustic events occurred around the time of setting. A layer of water on the surface of the cement pastes substantially reduced acoustic emission activity at the time of setting. According to these experimental results, the acoustic emission measured around setting time was attributed to cavitation events occurring in the pores of the cement paste due to self-desiccation. This paper shows how acoustic emission might be used to indicate the time when the fluid-solid transition occurs in a cement paste, often referred to as time-zero.

Data sets were comprised of images taken over a range of magnifications , from materials with different compositions and varying orientations of microstructural features. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction were performed prior to training machine learning algorithms to classify mi-crostructural image data. Visual bag of words, texture and shape statistics, and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (deep learning algorithms) were used for feature extraction. Classification was then performed using support vector machine, voting, nearest neighbors, and random forest models. For each model, classification was completed using full (original size) and reduced feature vectors for each feature extraction method tested. Performance comparisons were done to evaluate all possible combinations of feature extraction, selection, and classifiers for the task of micrograph classification. Results demonstrate that pre-trained neural networks represent microstruc-ture image data well, and when used for feature extraction yield the highest classification accuracies for the majority of classifier and feature selection methods tested. Thus, deep learning algorithms can successfully be applied to micrograph recognition tasks. Maximum classification accuracies of 91.85 ± 4.25% and 97.37± 3.33% for Tasks 1 and 2 respectively, were achieved. This work is a broad investigation of computer vision and machine learning methods that acts as a step towards applying these established methods to more sophisticated materials recognition or characterization tasks. The approach presented here could offer improvements over established stereological measurements by removing the requirement of expert knowledge (bias) for interpretation of image data prior to characterization.},

Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) has been widely used in HPC as a mineral admixture to improve the comprehensive workability. Nowadays, Temperature Stress Test Machine (TSTM) has been used to investigate the cracking potential of concrete. The influence of GGBFS on the early-age cracking potential of HPC has been investigated. However, investigations on the influence of GGBFS on the early-age cracking potential of HPC under adiabatic condition at full uniaxial restraint degree by using TSTM remain lacking. Investigations on the early-age cracking potential of HPC with different GGBFS contents (0%, 20%, 35%, and 50%) under adiabatic condition at full uniaxial restraint degree by using TSTM were conducted in the present study. The experimental results and related analysis indicated that (1) the addition of GGBFS reduced early-age temperature rise, temperature drop, cracking stress, cracking temperature, and stress reserve of HPC; (2) the autogenous shrinkage and integrated criterion of HPC increased with the increasing GGBFS content at early age; (3) the early-age cracking potential of HPC increased with the increasing GGBFS content, and the optimal GGBFS content shall not exceed 20% in the present study.},

The intrinsic creep properties of the C-S-H gel are assessed based on measurements of uniaxial compressive basic creep of cement pastes with different water-to-cement ratio (w/c), prepared either with pure cement or cement blended with fly ash or quartz. The viscoelastic response of the C-S-H was back-calculated from the macroscopic experimental creep results with Finite Element Method (FEM) homogenization. The numerical simulations show that the intrinsic viscoelastic behavior of the C-S-H gel follows a similar trend in different systems, independent of their w/c (in the range 0.35–0.63) and the binder used. The differences in the magnitude of the creep at the macroscopic scale in different cement-based systems appear to depend mainly on the volumetric fractions of the solid phases and on the porosity of the cement pastes.},

The parameters of the proposed model were identified on two different concretes, High Performance Concrete and Fibrous Self-Compacted Concrete - from simple experiments in the laboratory: uniaxial tension and compression tests, dynamic Young's modulus measurements, free and autogenous shrinkages, semi-adiabatic calorimetry. The proposed model has been implemented in a Finite Element code, and the numerical simulations of the laboratory tests have proved the model consistency. Furthermore, early-age experiments conducted on massive structures have also been simulated, in order to investigate the predictive capability of the model, and to assess the model performance in practical situations where varying temperatures are involved. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, very little data is available on the behaviour of concretes with CSA binders, in particular on their creep and shrinkage. This paper presents a study on volume stability of high-performance concretes with CSA binder, blended with, or completely replacing, Portland-limestone cement. Shrinkage and creep in both autogenous and drying conditions were measured from 1 day until 1 year. The experimental results were compared with the empirical models Model Code 2010 and ACI 209.R-92. The results indicate that standard models originally developed for Portland cement concretes do not allow to address the pronounced differences between the Portland and CSA-based concretes, since their main input data are merely based on compressive strength.},

   abstract = {Autogenous shrinkage (AS) of high-strength and high-performance concrete (HSHPC) is large, which easily leads to early-age cracks and then severely deteriorates the concrete durability. CaO-based expansive agent (CEA) is extensively applied to mitigate the AS of HSHPC, but CEA could not fully achieve its expansion efficacy in HSHPC because of its low water to binder ratio and water amount, causing that CEA hydrates incompletely and the concrete contracts sharply and substantially after the initial expansion. Pre-wetted ceramsite (PWC), as an internal curing agent, could decrease effectively the AS of HSHPC. Based on the mechanism of AS reduction of CEA and PWC, the combination use of CEA and PWC could reach a synergistic effect on AS in HSHPC. However, there still lacks a synthetic study on the effects of the compound use of PWC and CEA on the mechanical properties and autogenous deformation of concrete. Thus, this study carried out the experiments on mechanical behaviors and autogenous deformation of concrete with PWC or/and CEA addition. The test results claimed that the PWC addition enhanced the compressive and splitting tensile strength while the opposite results were obtained by CEA addition. In addition, both PWC and CEA addition weakened the dynamic elastic modulus of concrete. Meanwhile, the PWC and CEA incorporation had a significant improving effect on the internal relative humidity in concrete. The AS of concrete was greatly mitigated by PWC addition. The IC water of PWC could improve the expansion efficacy of CEA as well as greatly decrease the contraction at the later stage. A remarkable synergistic mechanism on AS mitigation was observed with the combined use of PWC and CEA, which is significantly beneficial to control the AS-induced cracking.},

It appears that the method based on the evolution of the chemically bound water gives the most reliable evolution of the hydration degree.

The creep behavior is simulated by applying a time-varying generalized Maxwell model on the individual elements of a finite-element mesh of a simulated three-dimensional microstructure and compared with results in the literature. All mechanical properties of the constituent phases are taken from literature and Maxwell chain parameters are obtained by fitting the intrinsic creep of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). A reasonable agreement between the simulations and the experimental results are obtained by assuming a constant C-S-H density of 2.0 g/cm 3 . It was found that better agreements could be obtained at low degree of hydrations, by assuming a loosely packed C-S-H growing in the microstructure. It was also found that the short-term creep characteristics of C-S-H from nanoindentation can be used to reproduce macroscopic creep at least over a few days. The results show how numerical models can be used to upscale phase characteristics to macroscopic properties of composites.},

To do so, different contents of air-entraining agent were used to simulate the internal defects of concrete and high-stress continuous load was applied to concrete samples with different initial defects. By analyzing the stress-strain curves of concretes containing different initial defects after compression, it was concluded that the existence of internal defects had a significant effect on the basic mechanical properties of concrete samples. Acoustic emission technology was used to obtain the internal acoustic emission response of concrete samples under high stress.

In case of restrained shrinkage or application of prestress load [1], creep plays an important role in the determination of the effective stress. The difficulty lies in the fact that the modeling of creep must be based on experimental data at early age and this data must be obtained automatically because the hardening process of the concrete takes place rapidly during the first hours and also the first days. This paper presents a new methodology to model basic creep in compression since setting. Two kinds of tests are used: classical loadings and repeated minute-scale-duration loadings. The classical test is used to characterize the creep function for one age at loading and the repeated minute-scale-duration loadings test is used to define two ageing factors for the creep function. A new model based on the physical mechanisms and the two ageing factors is presented. A comparison with the Model Code 2010 is done and an advanced way to consider ageing with the Model Code 2010 is presented.},

The model is then applied to study the influence of the microstructure on the macroscopic creep of concrete. We show that materials with finer particles exhibit less creep, and that the anisotropy of creep can be explained with the shape and orientation of the aggregates.

The aim of this paper is to numerically investigate the effect of size distribution and shape of elastic inclusions on the long-term creep of concrete. Several microstructures with prescribed size distribution and spherical or polyhedral shape of inclusions are generated. By using the 3D numerical homogenization procedure for viscoelastic microstructures proposed by Šmilauer and Bažant (2010), it is shown that the size distribution and shape of inclusions have no measurable influence on the overall creep behavior. Moreover, a mean-field estimate provides close predictions. An Interfacial Transition Zone was introduced according to the model of Nadeau (2003).

   abstract = {Creep and shrinkage are complicated time-dependent processes taking place in cementitious materials. In typical concretes, the most significant part of shrinkage is represented by drying shrinkage. Experimental data indicate that the ultimate value of drying shrinkage measured on concrete and mortar specimens is a nonlinear function of the ambient relative humidity. The nonlinear behavior is partially caused by microcracking, and partially by creep of C-S-H gel. On the other hand, drying shrinkage of hardened cement paste, measured on very thin specimens at a gradually decreasing relative humidity, was found to be a linear function of relative humidity. The aim of this paper is to explore whether the nonlinearities observed for macroscopic shrinkage can be explained by finite element simulations at lower levels, starting from the description of the drying cement paste by a viscoelastic model based on the Microprestress-Solidification Theory (MPS) with tensile cracking and with a constant shrinkage ratio.},

This study presents the first analysis of a large data set (>10,000 observations) of measured compressive strengths from actual (job-site) mixtures and their corresponding actual mixture proportions. Predictive models are applied to examine relationships between the mixture design variables and strength, and to thereby develop an estimate of the (28-day) strength. These models are also applied to a laboratory-based data set of strength measurements published by Yeh et al. (1998) and the performance of the models across both data sets is compared. Furthermore, to illustrate the value of such models beyond simply strength prediction, they are used to design optimal concrete mixtures that minimize cost and embodied CO2 impact while satisfying imposed target strengths.},

The prediction of the poro-visco-elastic response of the material to the internal stress was performed using a generalized Kelvin-Voigt model that also considered aging.

Higher conditioning relative humidity, pressure, and holding time aided consolidation of the powder and led to an improved elastic modulus. No remarkable influence of strain rate (0.025–0.1 s−1) and vibration frequency was noted. While the Al-incorporated C-A-S-H exhibited superior mechanical properties relative to C-S-H, all the C-(A-)S-H compacts yielded lower elastic modulus values as compared to data from fully hydrated C3S paste, mainly attributable the phase bonding, packing density, chemical composition, and the presence of phases other than C-(A-)S-H in the C3S sample.},

C-S-H seeding leads to a significant refinement of the pore structure at early stages of hydration. In the w/c 0.35 mortar with C-S-H seeding, higher mechanical properties are measured up to 1 d; later the effect of seeding becomes insignificant. On the other hand, in the w/c 0.30 mortar the mechanical properties at later ages were reduced with C-S-H seeding. At the same time, the faster refinement of porosity due to seeding at very early ages leads to faster self-desiccation in all mortars. Consequently, lower RH is reached, which is accompanied by higher autogenous shrinkage of the mortars with C-S-H seeding. As a countermeasure, superabsorbent polymers (SAP) were employed as internal curing agents to reduce self-desiccation and autogenous shrinkage in mortars with seeding agents.},

The porosity significantly influences the Young's modulus and the creep of the compacts, while the Ca/Si has limited influence on the Young's modulus. The C-S-H compacts with higher Ca/Si exhibit lower creep than those with lower Ca/Si, however mainly due to the presence of portlandite at higher Ca/Si values. The calculated Young's modulus of C-S-H solids falls into the range 21–50 GPa. The contact creep modulus of C-S-H with similar porosity as in a hardened cement paste (close to 30%) is about 180 GPa.},

Hereby, a calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) molecular model is developed to explain, for the first time, the creep characteristics at various stress states, temperature levels and water contents, which are not accessible experimentally. Rather tensile and compressive loadings, C-S-H only creeps under shear loadings originating from the sliding of the calcium silicate layers over each other as the interlayer component (water and ions) acts as a lubricator. A heterogeneous creep characteristic is observed. Elevated temperature reduces the interlayer lubricator viscosity and weakens the interfacial adhesion between the layers and the interlayer lubricator, which accelerates C-S-H creep. The removal of interlayer water enhances the creep resistance, resulting from the reduced interlayer space and enhanced interfacial adhesion. The atomic-level mechanisms explain the inter-CSH-particle behaviours at the microscale, which bridges the gap between atomistic simulation and microcosmic phenomenon.},

For this purpose, an experimental database consisting of 1030 records has been compiled from the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine. The database was used to train and validate four conventional machine learning (CML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear and Non-Linear Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS-L and MARS-C), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR). Subsequently, the predicted outputs of CML models were combined and trained using ANN to construct the Hybrid Ensemble Model (HENSM). It is observed that the proposed HENSM produces higher predictive accuracy compared to the CML models used in the present study. The predictive performance of all models for CS prediction was compared using the testing dataset and it is found that the HENSM model attained the highest predictive accuracy in both phases. Based on the experimental results, the newly constructed HENSM model is very potential to be a new alternative in handling the overfitting issues of CML models and hence, can be used to predict the concrete CS, including the design of less polluting and more sustainable concrete constructions.},

   abstract = {Concrete is the most used construction material for a century. After casting and setting, concrete shows various dimensional physical and mechanical evolutions, of which drying. It is a physical process, having though mechanical consequences. Drying accompanies the hardening of concrete and leads to significant dimensional changes that appear as cracks. The advent or absence of cracking depends not only on the potential contraction but also on the extensibility of concrete, it' s strength (the cracking due to shrinkage appears only in case the tensile strength of concrete has been over passed by the stresses, induced by shrinkage deformations), and its degree of restraint to the deformation that may lead to cracking. These cracks influence the durability of the concrete works. This study presents the application of a nonparametric approach called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict effectively dimensional variations due to drying shrinkage.Using this approach allows to develop models for predicting shrinkage. These models use a multi layer back propagation. They depend on a very large database of experimental results issued from literature (RILEM Data Bank), and an appropriate choice of architectures and learning processes. These models take into account the different parameters of concrete preservation and making which affect drying shrinkage of concrete as: Relative humidity (RH), Cure Period, volume to surface area ratio (V/S), water to cement ratio (W/C), and fine aggregate to total aggregate ratio or sand to total aggregate ratio (S/Ta). To validate these models, they are compared with parametric models as: B3, ACI 209, CEB and GL2000. In these comparisons, it appears that ANN approach describes correctly the evolution with time of drying shrinkage. A parametric study is also conducted to quantify the degree of influence of some the different parameters used in the developed neural network model. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Despite significant past research, such knowledge is currently inadequate and based on experimental data with questionable reliability, due mainly to the considerable challenges in testing early-age concrete. This paper first highlights the challenge and importance of collecting reliable test data on full tensile stress-deformation curves for very early-age concrete. Through identifying and effectively addressing critical drawbacks in previous test setups, an improved direct tensile testing system that can reliably capture simultaneously stress and deformation of concrete from the age of several hours after mixing has been successfully developed. Key features of the improved setup, including the air-bearing box for friction minimisation and digital image correlation for non-contact full-field deformation capturing, are then reported in the paper. Based on the newly collected data, fundamental tensile properties of concrete at very early ages are re-assessed and presented. Such properties include tensile strength, Young's modulus, strain at peak stress, fracture energy, performance under cyclic loading and tensile relaxation.},

However, the relationship, if any, between the structure and creep dynamics of gels remains elusive. Here, based on accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and the recently developed softness approach (i.e., classification-based machine learning), we reveal that the propensity of a gel to exhibit long-time creep is encoded in its static, unloaded structure. By taking the example of a calcium–silicate–hydrate gel (the binding phase of concrete), we extract a local, non-intuitive structural descriptor (a revised version of the “softness” metric proposed by the pioneering work from Cubuk et al.) that is strongly correlated with the dynamics of the particles. Notably, the macroscopic creep rate exhibits an exponential dependence on the average softness. We find that creep results in a decrease in softness in the gel structure, which, in turn, explains the gradual decay of the creep rate over time. Finally, we demonstrate that the softness metric is strongly correlated with the average energy barrier that is accessible to the particles.},

   abstract = {Under the project "EcoBéton" (Green concrete) funded by the French National Agency (ANR), concrete mixtures with a high quantity of mineral additions, such as blast-furnace slag and fly ash were studied. A first approach to quantify their cracking risk was to measure their plastic shrinkage evolution. In parallel, the evolution of other parameters such as setting, capillary depression and porosity were also monitored to relate this deformation to the evolution of the microstructure of the studied mixtures. Setting monitoring by means of ultrasonic measurements allows obtaining significant macroscopic information such as hardening process and rigidity evolution. The correlation between these different parameters shows that the plastic shrinkage evolution can be divided into three phases driven by different mechanisms. Moreover, it appears that the use of mineral additions has an effect on the plastic shrinkage behaviour, but this impact is not proportional to the percentage of additions. It depends on the hydration process and the microstructure of the cementitious materials. So, it seems that an optimum content of cement replacement by mineral additions must be sought to limit the development of plastic shrinkage of concretes with mineral additions at early age. However, a high rate of substitution of cement may affect the early age compressive strength of the concrete. So these mixtures were also optimised to obtain a significant compressive strength at an early age, but this optimisation leads to a higher risk of cracking for some of them. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is proposed to predict the anisotropic effective material properties for representative volume elements (RVEs) with random inclusions. The high-fidelity dataset generated by a computational homogenization approach is used for training the 3D-CNN models. The inference results of the trained networks on unseen data indicate that the network is capable of capturing the microstructural features of RVEs and produces an accurate prediction of effective stiffness and Poisson's ratio. The benefits of the 3D-CNN over conventional finite-element-based homogenization with regard to computational efficiency, uncertainty quantification and model's transferability are discussed in sequence. We find the salient features of the 3D-CNN approach make it a potentially suitable alternative for facilitating material design with fast product design iteration and efficient uncertainty quantification.},

Through ring test, the steel-concrete interfacial compressive stress generated from shrinkage of concrete is obtained first. Meanwhile, the theoretical value of the interfacial compressive stress is precisely calculated by a model for given shrinkage of concrete. In the model, a power function with three unknown constants was used to model the viscoelastic behavior of concrete under tension. The expected stress relaxation constants can then be determined with the condition that the difference between calculated and tested interfacial compressive stresses satisfies the required tolerance. Using this mythology, the creep relaxation parameters of three kinds of concretes with compressive strength at 28 days around 30 MPa, 50 MPa and 80 MPa are obtained. The determined stress relaxation parameters are used in the existing experimental results of shrinkage stress tests that are independently carried out and reasonable agreement between model and test data is found. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The micromechanical properties of Portland cement paste were investigated by the coupled nanoindentation and scanning electron microscope method. The mechanical parameters (e.g. indentation modulus and hardness) of individual active phases present in Portland cement paste were estimated by the proposed method. From the mechanical parameters of Portland cement paste at the micro-scale, the evolution of elastic modulus of Portland cement paste at the macro-scale was predicted by a homogenization method and the geometries of the main constituents in Portland cement paste were taken into account.

The well-established ultrasonic pulse transmission velocity (UPV) method can be correlated to the setting process of mortar by the measurement of P-waves. However, S-waves seem to be better indicators of the setting of cement-based materials, since they are more sensitive to the solid matrix connectivity. This study proposes a new methodology, based on the combined monitoring of P- and S-waves, to determine the setting time of mortars containing two types of fly ashes. The S-waves velocity and dynamic elastic properties seem to be the most accurate indicators of the setting process, allowing capturing microstructural evolutions that isothermal calorimetry or usual UPV methods do not detect.},

Supplementary techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with backscattered electron (BSE) and continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) are also adopted to analyze the effects of load magnitude, microstructure, and age on the mechanical and creep properties. It is found that mechanical properties decreases with increasing applied load, the properties of composite instead of the individual phase in hardened cement paste can be measured by an indentation load of 1.5 N or greater. The projected area quantified by the radius (d) of interacting volume underneath the indent tip can be a better representation of the affecting area by indentation. Porous structure shows greater microcreep and shorter characteristic time, the contact creep function [L(t) − L(0)] of outer C-S-H is 30% greater than that of inner C-S-H.

In this paper, the mechanism of autogenous shrinkage of HPC and influential factors in its development are discussed. In general, autogenous shrinkage is more pronounced in HPC, albeit, using low heat cement, fly ash, shrinkage reducing agents, lightweight aggregates, and fibers can effectively reduce it.

More specifically, in the first part, the shrinkage and fracture properties of a non-reinforced concrete have been experimentally considered, along with the characterization of several material parameters. The experimental results exhibit a high risk of early-age cracking for this kind of concrete. Especially, the fracture phenomena are complex, including multi-evolution-stages, initiation, propagation, stop-growing, and re-growing. In the second part, the computational modeling based on the phase field method of failure mechanism is applied to simulate the thermal, mechanical and fracture behavior due to early-age hydration. A detailed discussion on the identification of model/material parameters and the construction of numerical model including the boundary conditions is given. We provide the following comparison between predictions of the numerical simulation with the experimental observations. An excellent predictive capability of the computational model is noted.

Statistical analysis are carried out and shows that grayscale values from X-ray CT scans of slag pastes can be linearly correlated with nanoindentation measurements of elastic modulus. Simulations of uniaxial tension are then performed for varying w/c ratios using the Delft lattice model and microstructure obtained from X-ray CT. In addition, advanced micromechanical experiments for estimating the micro-scale tensile strength and elastic modulus are performed. Experimental and simulation results are then critically discussed and compared. It shows that simulation results match the measured tensile strength quite well although some discrepancy does exist at lower w/c ratios. In addition, the observations are compared to our previous findings on ordinary Portland cement pastes. It is found that tensile strength and elastic moduli of slag pastes at 28 days are higher than those of Portland cement pastes with the same w/c ratio.

However, several aspects concerning the measured indentation creep (e.g., recoverable or irrecoverable, the underlying mechanisms) are still unclear. This study investigated the micro creep and creep recovery of mature cement paste by indentation technique. Continuous stiffness measurement tests were first carried out to determine the indentation force required to measure the homogeneous properties of cement paste. Then the micro creep and creep recovery of cement paste were measured via microindentation tests that contain a holding stage at the maximum indentation force and a reholding stage incorporated into the unloading stage. It is found that both the recoverable creep and irrecoverable creep can be measured by the microindentation tests. The micro recoverable creep of cement paste that mainly evolves over the loading stage is about 30–40% of the total creep, and the logarithm of the micro creep recovery rate decreases bilinearly with respect to time, which are consistent with the observed creep recovery at macro scale. The long-term creep rate of cement paste appears independent of loading duration, holding duration, indentation force amplitude, and unloading duration of the microindentation tests, suggesting it is an intrinsic material parameter. The identification of recoverable and irrecoverable creep at micro scale can contribute to a better understanding of the creep mechanisms of cementitious materials.},

First, concrete samples made of cement paste, mortar and concrete with a water-to-cement ratio of 0.6 were cured and loaded in sealed condition at a age of 90 days under UCCT for a duration of 1 year. A convergence study showed that the duration of UCCT which is needed to accurately estimate the characteristic time τch and creep modulus C is about 30 days and 300 days, respectively. Then, the creep modulus C was measured by microindentation tests on the cement paste and homogenized at the scale of mortar and concrete by micromechanics. Finally, the compliance creep function obtained by the proposed two-scale method was compared to experimental results which are available in open literature and other ones of existing design models, such as the model code 2010 and the well-established B4 model. As main result, the proposed simplified method which combines short (2-month) UCCT and rapid microindentation tests showed to be practical and accurate to characterize the basic creep compliance function of concrete.},

Methodologies of the CSM technique used for the characterization of layered materials and nonhomogeneous composites are reviewed and discussed. Applications of the CSM technique to the measurement of contact stiffness, elastic modulus, hardness, creep resistance, and fatigue properties of the materials used in magnetic storage devices are presented. The nanoindentation CSM technique, in conjunction with nanoscratch and friction and wear tests, can be satisfactorily used for the materials characterization of magnetic storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and should find more application.

The test results show that carbonation reaction causes significant reduction of the frequencies of elastic modulus in the 7∼34GPa and 83∼160GPa, meanwhile a dramatic increase of the frequency of elastic modulus in the 34∼83GPa. Both portlandite, C-S-H gel and unhydrated cement particles are susceptible to carbonation. The elastic modulus frequency value of LD C-S-H and HD C-S-H after carbonation decreases by 85.4% and 55.5%, respectively. LD C-S-H is more heavily affected by the carbonation degradation compared to HD C-S-H. Before carbonation reaction, the size of unhydrated cement particles is about 15∼30um, and the hydrated products wrap around the unhydrated cement particles and the elastic modulus decreases progressively outward from the center of cement particles. After carbonation reaction, the number and size of unhydrated cement particles decreased obviously.},

This study reports an experimental investigation on the “time-zero” of AAFS pastes characterized by different techniques. It is found that the internal capillary pressure in AAFS pastes significantly increased after 5–7.5 h, which is far beyond the final setting time that is normally regarded as “time-zero” for Portland cement. The transition time derived from capillary pressure method directly captures the alteration of capillary stress in AAFS, which matches well with the change of the shrinkage slope. Due to the moisture equilibrium between the specimens and humidity sensor, it is hard to use the measured internal relative humidity to determine the real “time-zero” of AAFS. This research finds that the onset of capillary pressure in AAFS paste provides a more scientific and accurate determination of “time-zero”.},

Their thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviour (activation process, hydration reactions and mechanical properties' evolution) is investigated in the literature. However, few studies addressing their cracking tendency can be found. This paper focuses on the cracking risks induced by thermal and delayed strains' restriction, at materials' early age. First, the results of an experimental campaign comparing the early-age behaviour of an alkali-activated slag mortar to that of an OPC based mortar are discussed. Second, a simplified approach allowing comparing the cracking tendency of both materials is proposed. The alkali-activated mortar undergoes autogenous shrinkage strains higher then OPC mortar and showing an increase even at long term. However, its basic creep strains are more important than OPC mortar, tested in the same conditions. This implies a higher capacity of stress relaxation for the alkali-activated slag mortar. Regarding the evolution of mechanical properties, Young modulus and tensile strengths of the alkali-activated mortar are lower of those of OPC based mortar at all ages. A simplified cracking index comparison applied at this stage of study shows comparable cracking risks of both materials at 7 days, higher risks for alkali-activated slag mortar at 28 days.},

A total of 416 data points including the concrete composition, curing condition, age of concrete, water-to-cement (binder) ratio, internal relative humidity, elastic modulus, and measured autogenous shrinkage are selectively collected for the model establishment. The effects of silica fume on the development of autogenous shrinkage are also considered. Upon the sound physical basis, the model requires only a few parameter inputs related to the mixture proportion and physicochemical properties of constituents. The reasonable agreements between the analytical predictions and independent experimental results, as well as common used formulas from different codes (i.e., ACI 209, Eurocode 2, and Model Code 2010), demonstrate that the time-dependent evolution of autogenous shrinkage of HPC can be reasonably predicted by the model proposed in this study.},

It was expanded as the RILEM database in 1992 and further in 2008. A major expansion, completely restructured and verified, named the NU Database, is now presented. The number of the test curves of creep and drying shrinkage is more than doubled and over 400 test curves of autogenous shrinkage are added. The database covers longer measurement periods and encompasses the effects of admixtures in modern concrete mixtures. The database contains roughly 1400 creep and 1800 shrinkage curves, of which approximately 800 creep and 1050 shrinkage curves contain admixtures. Their analysis shows significant influence of admixtures on the creep and shrinkage behavior. The mixture proportions, testing conditions, and specimen geometries are documented in greater detail, and information on the admixture contents and aggregate types is included. The new database makes it possible to calibrate and verify improved creep and shrinkage prediction models. Additionally, the statistics of the mixture parameters, strength distributions, and scatter of the compliance curves have been extracted for applications in reliability engineering and probabilistic performance assessment. Data analysis brings to light various recommendations for testing and recording, and suggests corrections of various oversights distorting the reported data. These recommendations would make future test data more useful, consistent, complete, and reliable.

   abstract = {These lecture notes highlight the mathematical and computational structure relating to the formulation of, and development of algorithms for, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems in differential equations. This approach is fundamental in the quantification of uncertainty within applications involving the blending of mathematical models with data. The finite-dimensional situation is described first, along with some motivational examples. Then the development of probability measures on separable Banach space is undertaken, using a random series over an infinite set of functions to construct draws; these probability measures are used as priors in the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. Regularity of draws from the priors is studied in the natural Sobolev or Besov spaces implied by the choice of functions in the random series construction, and the Kolmogorov continuity theorem is used to extend regularity considerations to the space of Hölder continuous functions. Bayes' theorem is derived in this prior setting, and here interpreted as finding conditions under which the posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior, and determining a formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative in terms of the likelihood of the data. Having established the form of the posterior, we then describe various properties common to it in the infinite-dimensional setting. These properties include well-posedness, approximation theory, and the existence of maximum a posteriori estimators. We then describe measure-preserving dynamics, again on the infinite-dimensional space, including Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods, and measure-preserving reversible stochastic differential equations. By formulating the theory and algorithms on the underlying infinite-dimensional space, we obtain a framework suitable for rigorous analysis of the accuracy of reconstructions, of computational complexity, as well as naturally constructing algorithms which perform well under mesh refinement, since they are inherently well defined in infinite dimensions.},

   abstract = {Concrete, the solid that forms at room temperature from mixing Portland cement with water, sand, and aggregates, suffers from time-dependent deformation under load. This creep occurs at a rate that deteriorates the durability and truncates the lifespan of concrete structures. However, despite decades of research, the origin of concrete creep remains unknown. Here, we measure the in situ creep behavior of calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H), the nano-meter sized particles that form the fundamental building block of Portland cement concrete. We show that C-S-H exhibits a logarithmic creep that depends only on the packing of 3 structurally distinct but compositionally similar C-S-H forms: low density, high density, ultra-high density. We demonstrate that the creep rate (1/t) is likely due to the rearrangement of nanoscale particles around limit packing densities following the free-volume dynamics theory of granular physics. These findings could lead to a new basis for nanoengineering concrete materials and structures with minimal creep rates monitored by packing density distributions of nanoscale particles, and predicted by nanoscale creep measurements in some minute time, which are as exact as macroscopic creep tests carried out over years. C oncrete is the most-used construction material on earth. The annual worldwide production stands at 20 billion tons and increases per annum by 5%. However, the fundamental causes of concrete creep are still an enigma, and have deceived many decoding attempts from both experimental (1-3) and theoretical sides (4-8). In the United States alone, concrete creep is partly responsible for an estimated 78.8 billion dollars required annually for highway and bridge maintenance. Although it is generally agreed that the complex creep behavior of concrete materials is largely related to the viscoelastic response of the primary hydration product and binding phase of hardened Portland cement paste, the calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the creep properties of C-S-H have never been measured directly. C-S-H precipitates when cement and water are mixed, as clusters of nanoscale colloidal particles (9, 10) that cannot be recapitulated ex situ in bulk form suitable for macroscopic testing. Over decades, therefore, concrete creep properties have been probed on the composite scale of mortar and concrete (11), with the conclusion that there are 2 distinct creep phenomena at play (Fig. 1 A and B): a short-term volumetric creep and a long-term creep associated with shear deformation (3, 7, 12, 13), with a creep rate evolving as a power function t n of exponent n between 0.9 and 1 (14). The assessment of this long-term creep is most critical for the durability of concrete structures, and requires, for a specific concrete composition and structural application, years of expensive macroscopic testing (11, 14). After more than 40 years of research (4-8), basic questions persist regarding the physical origin of this logarithmic creep and its link with microstructure and composition. In this study, we investigate the creep properties of C-S-H. This is achieved by means of a statistical nanoindentation technique (SNT), described and validated previously (15-17), which is most suitable for the in situ investigation of mechanical phase properties and microstructure of highly heterogeneous hydrated composite materials. Like the classical indentation technique, an indenter tip (here a 3-sided pyramid Berkovich tip) is pushed orthogonally to the surface of the cement paste, and both the load applied to the tip, and the displacement of the tip with respect to the surface are recorded. By applying continuum-based constitutive models to the resulting load-displacement curve, mechanical properties of the indented material are determined. Applied to heterogeneous and mul-tiphase materials, the SNT then consists of carrying out a large array of such nanoindentation tests, and by applying statistical deconvolution techniques (15, 16) and micromechanical models to link microstructure to phase properties (17-19). Results Nine cement pastes of different compositions representative of a large range of real Portland concretes, were tested. They differed by their water-to-cement (w/c) mass ratio ranging from w/c 0.15 to w/c 0.40, heat treatment, and mineral additions, including silica fumes and calcareous fillers. The samples were prepared according to a procedure described in a previous study (20). On each sample 2 series of statistical nanoindentation tests were carried out that differ in the loading protocol: the first series assesses the microstructure from indentation hardness and indentation stiffness results; obtained by a trapezoidal load history with a maximum load of P max 2 mN, applied in 10 s, kept constant over 5 s and unloaded in 10 s. Following fast loading, the 5-s dwelling time is short enough to ensure that the indentation hardness, H P max /A c (with A c the projected area of contact between the indenter probe and the indented surface), is representative of the strength content (19, 23, 24). In turn, the unloading is fast enough so that the indentation modulus M, determined from the unloading slope S (dP/ dh) hh max at the end of the holding phase truly relates to the elasticity content of the indented material (25), namely the indentation modulus M E/(1 2) S/(2a U), with E the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and a U A c / the radius of contact between the indenter probe and the indented surface upon unloading (21, 22, 26). The load protocol of the second series differs from the first in a 180-s long dwelling period, which allows the assessment of the contact creep compliance rate, L ˙ (t) 2a U h ˙ h/P max , and the creep compliance, L(t) 2a U h(t)/P max const, from the time-dependent indentation depth rate h ˙ (t) and the change in indentation depth h(t) h(t) h 0 in excess of the indentation depth h 0 200 nm 45 nm recorded during the 10-s loading to P max 2 mN (Fig. 1C). In each series on the 9 samples, 400 nanoindentation tests were performed, of which on-average 282 indentations were identified as indents on C-S-H phases, recognized by an indentation modulus and hardness smaller than the C-S-H particle stiffness and hardness, M m s 63.5 GPa and H h s 3 GPa, determined in previous studies (16, 17, 27). In all tests on C-S-H phases, after correcting for thermal drift effects of the indenter equipment, a least square fitting of h(t) h(t) h 0 demonstrates an indentation creep compliance of the C-S-H phases that is logarithmic with regard to time (Fig.},

The nanostructures of inner and outer C-S-H are simulated by the packing of mono-sized (5 nm) spheres. The pore structures (capillary pores and gel pores) of Portland cement paste are established by upgrading the simulated nanostructures of C-S-H to the simulated microstructures of Portland cement paste. The pore size distribution of Portland cement paste is simulated by using the image segmentation method (Shapiro and Stockman, 2001) to analyse the simulated pore structures of Portland cement paste. The simulation results indicate that the pore size distribution of the simulated capillary pores of Portland cement paste at the age of 1 day to 28 days is in a good agreement with the pore size distribution determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pore size distribution of the simulated gel pores of Portland cement paste (interlayer gel pores of outer C-S-H and gel pores of inner C-S-H are not included) is validated by the pore size distribution obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The pores with pore size of 20 nm to 100 nm occupy very small volume fraction in the simulated Portland cement paste at each curing time (0.69% to 1.38%). This is consistent with the experimental results obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Originality-The numerical simulation of the pore structures of cement paste both including capillary pores and gel pores was merely reported. Both the capillary and gel pores of Portland cement paste are simulated in this study. The pore size distributions of the simulated gel pores and capillary pores of Portland cement paste are validated by the experiments determined by SEM, MIP and NMR.-Both the simulation results and the experimental results obtained by NMR indicate that the pores with pore size of 20 nm to 100 nm occupy very few volume fraction in the Portland cement paste (less than 1.38%). The volume fraction of the pores with size of 20 nm to 100 nm determined by MIP method reaches approximate 10%. If the simulation results are reasonable, the pore size distribution obtained by MIP is inappropriate. It should be emphasized that MIP is very frequently used to determine the pore structures of cementitious materials, which provides us an inappropriate information on the pore structure of cement paste. From this view point, this study provides us a new understanding of the pore structure of cement paste.},

COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of "extremeness". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient.

Some of the early age temperature effects on the concrete behaviour can be accurately taken into consideration by well-known maturity functions. However, the effect of temperature on the autogenous deformations development is more complex, and results in contradictory evidence. This paper studies the influence of various isothermal curing temperatures from 10 °C to 30 °C on the autogenous deformations of concrete. Binary and ternary binders containing up to 30% of limestone filler and 70% of blast-furnace slag are studied. The amplitude of both the self-desiccation deformation and the early age swelling deformation are observed to decrease with increasing temperature, whatever the binder nature. Mechanisms for this observation are suggested, and a corresponding model is developed. The effect of the binder nature, age and temperature on the autogenous deformations is assessed with this model. Based on this new model, it is shown that the effect of temperature on the autogenous deformation development can be either beneficial or detrimental, depending on the nature of the binder.},

The last review on such matter was conducted only in early 2000s; however, a significant amount of studies has been conducted since then and considerable advancements or modifications in this testing method have taken place over the last decade. Studies on the traditional ring test, i.e. a circular concrete ring cast around a steel ring, are identified and the history, tendencies, practices and quantitative methods are analysed thoroughly. Furthermore, any modifications/advancements in the testing method with respect to their purpose, applications and capabilities based on current knowledge, are addressed. Finally, an insight on the challenges that the developers of testing methods for restrained shrinkage are faced with is given together with perspectives for their future potential improvement.},

   abstract = {In high-performance concrete (HPC) subjected to high temperature during tunnel fires, the build-up of vapor pressure due to dehydration of the cement hydration products cannot be relieved due to the very low porosity and permeability of this type of concrete, often resulting in explosive spalling. Explosive spalling may cause devastating damage of the tunnel structure, which threatens both, civilians and emergency response units. This work suggests a potential application of silica aerogel in the protection of concrete linings, which consists in decorating the surface of HPC structures with a highly-insulating aerogel-cement mortar layer, with the aim of delaying the heating of the HPC and extending the performance of the main concrete structure of the tunnel under fire. The main aim of this study is investigating the impact of the microstructure, with special focus on the pore structure, on the thermal conductivity and the mechanical properties of the aerogel mortars. In particular, the integrity of the aerogels in the mortars, both in the mixing process and the possible long-term chemical degradation, was a main concern. Finally, a preliminary test of the performance against fire spalling was performed. While aerogel-containing mortars were able to protect HPC cubes from fire spalling under a specific thermal loading protocol, the thermal conductivity and the mechanical properties obtained were similar to those of cellular concrete in the same range of total porosity. A possible explanation of the lower-than-expected insulation performance is the partial degradation of the aerogel filler by reaction with the alkaline pore solution of the mortars. Implications of these new findings on aerogel-cement mixtures are also discussed.},

Especially, for the first time, integrated control processes for every sub-system/component are also explained in detail to supplement the lack in current reference sources and encourage future developments. Also, in this paper, verification steps to confirm the reliability and repeatability of the machine are discussed. Finally, to illustrate its practicability and capability in concrete research, the last section briefs several aspects of an on-going study at UQ utilising the TSTM to study autogenous shrinkage under various temperature histories, thermal coefficients of expansion and contraction, tensile creep, zero-stress temperature and Young's modulus, as well as their combined effects on early-age cracking risk of concrete structures.

   abstract = {The shrinkage of concrete when exposed to external drying influences the accurate quantification of concrete creep. To reduce the effect of shrinkage on the measured creep, particularly for concrete at early ages when the shrinkage is pronounced, a flexural creep test set-up was designed in this study to investigate the creep property of concrete beams with w/c ratios of 0.3 and 0.4 at the age of 7 days. The concrete beams were exposed to both sealed and drying conditions. A sequential coupled hydromechanical finite element analysis was conducted to back-calculate the creep parameters in the original microprestress solidification theory-based creep model from the measured creep-induced deflection. The results show that the flexural creep test is capable of obtaining the intrinsic creep property of concrete without incorporating the shrinkage effect as long as the relative humidity distribution in the concrete beams is symmetric about the neutral plane. The intrinsic creep property depends only on the mixture proportions of concrete, i.e., it is independent of the loading and drying conditions, which can be used to predict the deflection development of concrete beam under other complex drying conditions. The findings in this study provide a new methodology of obtaining concrete creep, which solves the problem of the conventional uniaxial creep testing method that both creep strain and shrinkage strain need to be measured during the creep test.},

The stresses in AAS and AASF concrete are calculated based on the experimental results while taking into consideration the influence brought by creep and relaxation. It is found that AAS and AASF concrete showed lower autogenous shrinkage-induced stress and later cracking compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based concrete with similar compressive strength, despite the higher autogenous shrinkage of AAS and AASF concrete. The low autogenous shrinkage-induced stress in the AAC is mainly attributed to the pronounced stress relaxation. A good prediction of the stress evolution in AAC is obtained by taking into account the elastic part of the autogenous shrinkage and the stress relaxation. In contrast, calculations ignoring the creep and relaxation would lead to a significant overestimation of the stress in AAC.},

The type of structural damage and its severity are identified based on the allowed range of concrete crack width for different structures, including buildings and bridges based on different international standards and codes. The proposed method can deploy unmanned aerial vehicle image acquisition to offer a nearly automated inspection platform for the colossal backlog of aging concrete structures.},

   abstract = {The concrete is today the building material by excellence. Drying accompanies the hardening of concrete and leads to significant dimensional changes that appear as cracks. These cracks influence the durability of the concrete works. Deforming a concrete element subjected to long-term loading is the sum of said instantaneous and delayed deformation due to creep deformation. Concrete creep is the continuous process of deformation of an element, which exerts a constant or variable load. It depends in particular on the characteristics of concrete, age during loading, the thickness of the element of the environmental humidity, and time. Creep is a complex phenomenon, recognized but poorly understood. It is related to the effects of migration of water into the pores and capillaries of the matrix and to a process of reorganization of the structure of hydrated binder crystals. Applying a nonparametric approach called artificial neural network (ANN) to effectively predict the dimensional changes due to creep drying is the subject of this research. Using this approach allows to develop models for predicting creep. These models use a multilayer backpropagation. They depend on a very large database of experimental results issued from the literature (RILEM Data Bank) and on appropriate choice of architectures and learning processes. These models take into account the different parameters of concrete preservation and making, which affect drying creep of concrete as relative humidity, cure period, water-to-cement ratio (W/C), volume-to-surface area ratio (V/S), and fine aggregate-to-total aggregate ratio, or fine aggregate-to-total aggregate ratio. To validate these models, they are compared with parametric models as B3, ACI 209, CEB, and GL2000. In these comparisons, it appears that ANN approach describes correctly the evolution with time of drying creep. A parametric study is also conducted to quantify the degree of influence of some of the different parameters used in the developed neural network model.},

   abstract = {According to physical analyses, the driving force of autogenous shrinkage of concrete is the change in the capillary pressure induced by self-desiccation in its cement matrix. Self-desiccation is caused by the balance between the absolute volume reduction (chemical shrinkage) and the building up of the capillary network. The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of the cement characteristics on the chain of mechanisms leading from hydration to autogenous deformations. Four parameters were selected: (i) for clinker, the amount of C3A and free lime and the SO3/K2O ratio; (ii) for cement, the fineness. To master the experimental area, 16 cements were prepared at the laboratory from pure raw materials. An important number of characterizing techniques were used in the experimental study. Their choice was based on the important parameters drawn from the physical analysis: setting time, suspension-solid transition, hydration kinetics through isothermal calorimetry and nonevaporable water, chemical shrinkage, evolution of relative humidity, capillary porosity and autogenous shrinkage. Using different techniques allowed to determine the precise mechanism of action of each parameter. Results showed that these mechanisms are generally different, even if their macroscopic consequences may be identical. This point will probably be useful for modeling and determining the industrial keys reducing the autogenous shrinkage. The physical mechanisms involved in autogenous deformations were further understood. In particular, this study shows that initial autogenous shrinkage should be considered as a balance between the self-desiccation and an initial swelling phase. The influence of the four parameters considered on this last phenomenon were also characterized. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The influencing mechanism of coarse aggregate size on the drying-induced microcracking of concrete was clarified: (1) As the coarse aggregate size decreases, propagation paths of microcracking are increased, which increase the number of small microcracks and release the drying shrinkage force from mortar phase. (2) Tensile stress shells surrounding the coarse aggregates become thinner, thereby decreasing the area of large microcracks. As the coarse aggregate size decreased from 16-20 mm to 5–10 mm, the average thickness of tensile stress shells decreased from 2.13 mm to 1.09 mm at the beginning of drying, and the area of the microcracks >5 μm in width decreased from 796.6 mm2/m2 to 340.2 mm2/m2 at 60 days since drying.},

   abstract = {An improved law of creep of concrete at constant humidity and temperature is proposed. The well-known double power law gives too high a final slope of creep curves compared to available test data. This is remedied by a new formula which exhibits a continuous transition from a power curve to a straight line in the logarithm of creep duration. The straight line has the same slope for all ages at loading, and the higher the age at loading, the longer is the duration at which the transition occurs. The exponent of the initial power curve is higher than that used in the double power law and is much too high in comparison with the existing test results for very short load durations in the dynamic range. This penalty, however, is outweighed by better extrapolation to very long load durations. The new formula significantly restricts the occurrence of divergence of creep curves at various ages at loading but does not eliminate it completely unless closeness of data fit is sacrificed. The new formula also greatly reduces the occurrence of negative values at the end of calculated stress relaxation curves. Extensive statistical analysis of most test data available in the literature reveals a relatively modest improvement in the overall coefficient of variation for the deviations of the formula from test data and a significant improvement for the deviations of the final slope from its measured value. The same improvements were achieved in an earlier study in which the transition from the power law to the logarithmic law was abrupt, with a discontinuity in curvature. The continuity of curvature in the present formulation is desirable for applications in data extrapolation.},

For this purpose a new, unconditionally stable numerical algorithm is presented, allowing an arbitrary increase of the time step as the creep rate decays. E#, The rate-type formulation permits establishing a correlation with the rate processes in the microstructure and thus opens the way toward rational generalizations to variable temperature and J(t, t') water content. The previously developed Kelvin-type chain also permits such a correlation, but its identification from test. data is more complicated.

To determine the slag effect on cracking, this study focuses on the autogenous deformation evolution of concretes characterized by different percentages of slag (0 and 42% of the binder mass) under free and restraint conditions by means of the TSTM device (Temperature Stress Testing Machine). Despite the fast kinetics of its autogenous deformation, the cracking appears later for the slag cement concrete than for the Portland cement concrete. This behaviour is related to the swelling of its cementitious matrix at early age and its large capacity for relaxing the stresses. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {The viscoelastic creep response of flexural beams and beam-columns made with functionally graded materials is numerically investigated. The paper highlights the challenges associated with the modeling and analysis of such structures, and presents a nonlinear theoretical model for their bending and creep buckling analysis. The model accounts for the viscoelasticity of the materials using differential-type constitutive relations that are based on the linear Boltzmann's principle of superposition. The model is general in terms of its ability to deal with any material volume faction distribution through the depth of the beam, and with different linear viscoelastic laws, boundary conditions, and loading schemes. The governing equations are solved through time stepping numerical integration, which yields an exponential algorithm following the expansion of the relaxation function into a Dirichlet series. A numerical study that examines the capabilities of the model and quantifies the creep response of functionally graded beam-columns is presented, with special focus on the stresses and strains redistribution over time and on the creep buckling response. The results show that the creep response of such structures can be strongly nonlinear due to the variation of the viscoelastic properties through the depth, along with unique phenomena that are not observed in homogenous structures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In mass or sealed concrete and high-performance concrete, hydration of cement leads to internal consumption of moisture, resulting in autogenous shrinkage, and, prior to setting while still in a plastic state, plastic shrinkage of cement paste will occur if loss of moisture is permitted. Under normal drying environmental conditions, moisture diffuses from the hardened concrete, resulting in drying shrinkage, which includes carbonation shrinkage due to the reaction with carbon dioxide in the environmental air. Influencing factors in all those different types of shrinkage are discussed, together with measurement and prediction of autogenous shrinkage; standard methods of prediction of drying shrinkage are considered, together with creep, in Chapter 11.},

It is found that the short-term creep of cement paste at microscale can be satisfactorily described by a power-law function. A linear viscoelastic behaviour has been observed in different cementitious systems at the microscale with the stress level up to 67.9%. When compared with the creep results in microindentation tests and conventional macroscopic tests, the obtained creep compliance function in this study is found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively representative of the macroscopic results.

It was expanded as the RILEM database in 1992 and further in 2008. A major expansion, completely restructured and verified, named the NU Database, is now presented. The number of the test curves of creep and drying shrinkage is more than doubled and over 400 test curves of autogenous shrinkage are added. The database covers longer measurement periods and encompasses the effects of admixtures in modern concrete mixtures. The database contains roughly 1400 creep and 1800 shrinkage curves, of which approximately 800 creep and 1050 shrinkage curves contain admixtures. Their analysis shows significant influence of admixtures on the creep and shrinkage behavior. The mixture proportions, testing conditions, and specimen geometries are documented in greater detail, and information on the admixture contents and aggregate types is included. The new database makes it possible to calibrate and verify improved creep and shrinkage prediction models. Additionally, the statistics of the mixture parameters, strength distributions, and scatter of the compliance curves have been extracted for applications in reliability engineering and probabilistic performance assessment. Data analysis brings to light various recommendations for testing and recording, and suggests corrections of various oversights distorting the reported data. These recommendations would make future test data more useful, consistent, complete, and reliable.

A comparative evaluation on three UCI data sets and 10 standard algorithms show, that it can detect global outliers as reliable as state-of-the-art algorithms, but it performs poor on local outlier problems.

   abstract = {Recent compilation of data on numerous large-span prestressed segmentally erected box girder bridges revealed gross underestimation of their multi-decade deflections. The main cause has been identified as incorrect and obsolete creep prediction models in various existing standard recommendations and is being addressed in a separate study. However, previous analyses of the excessive deflections of the Koror-Babeldaob (KB) Bridge in Palau and of four Japanese bridges have shown that a more accurate method of multi-decade creep analysis is required. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive presentation, appropriate not only for bridges but also for any large creep-sensitive structure. For each time step, the solution is reduced to an elastic structural analysis with generally orthotropic elastic moduli and eigenstrains. This analysis should normally be three-dimensional (3-D). It can be accomplished with a commercial finite element code such as ABAQUS. Based on the Kelvin chain model, the integral-type creep law is converted to a rate-type form with internal variables, which account for the previous history. For time steps short enough to render aging during each step to be negligible , a unique continuous retardation spectrum for each step is obtained by Laplace transform inversion using simple Widder's formula. Discretization of the spectrum then yields the current Kelvin chain moduli. The rate-type creep analysis is computation-ally more efficient than the classical integral-type analysis. More importantly, though, it makes it possible to take into account the evolution of various inelastic and nonlinear phenomena such as tensile cracking, cyclic creep, and stress relaxation in prestressing tendons at variable strain, as well as the effects of humidity and temperature variations, and the effect of wall thickness variation on drying creep and shrinkage. Finally, the advantages compared to the existing commercial programs, based on step-by-step integration of memory integrals, are pointed out and illustrated by a simple example.},

   abstract = {An investigation on the gain of physical properties of concrete with time and experimental results on the development of com-pressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and Poisson's ratio are reported. The results show that the elastic modulus developed much faster than either the tensile or the compressive strength, which developed at approximately the same rate. Poisson's ratio did not change substantially with either richness of mix or age of concrete and did not vary appreciably with time after 6 hr. The period within the first 12 hr after casting was observed to be the period of fastest development of physical properties. Pressure on the concrete industry to reduce construction schedules has led to subjecting concrete members to loads long before the conventional 28-day curing period has been completed. This trend in loading has brought about the need for a more thorough understanding of the time rates of development of various physical properties of concrete. The determination of early-age physical properties of concrete is at the forefront of concrete technology, as evidenced by the formation of an American Concrete Institute (ACI) technical committee (ACI 231) on properties of concrete at early ages. Francis Young, chairman of ACI 231, emphasized the importance of determining how properties (including but not limited to compressive strength) develop in early stages (1). The main objectives of the investigation reported here were as follows: (a) obtain a fundamental understanding of the rate of development of physical properties in concrete, particularly within the first 3 days after casting; and (b) generate data describing the time variation of development of physical properties in concrete with particular reference to the early age of concrete. This study investigated the development of the following physical property parameters at early ages: 1. Compressive strength (!~), 2. Modulus of elasticity in compression (Ee), 3. Splitting tensile strength (f,), and 4. Poisson's ratio (v). These parameters were not chosen randomly; they were selected on the basis of their importance to safe concrete design and construction practices. Compressive strength, to which all other physical strength parameters appear related, is considered the most important physical property of concrete. Compressive Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tennessee , Knox-ville, Tenn. 37996-2010. strength influences the operation of concrete precasting plants. Release of strands in the precast, prestressed concrete industry without detrimental losses requires a knowledge of com-pressive strength and tensile strength development. Furthermore , adequate knowledge of these properties is necessary for safe form stripping and early load applications. The static elastic modulus is another important characteristic of concrete. It is a basic parameter necessary for estimating prestress losses, immediate and time-dependent deformations due to early loading, and tensile strain capacity. Although it is generally assumed that concrete performance is governed primarily by its compression capabilities, tensile strength (which directly influences cracking at prestress release and shear capacity) is important for the appearance and durability of concrete structural members. Variation of te nsile strength with time is important in predicting concrete shear strength at different curing times. The variation of static elastic modulus of concrete is also useful in predicting early-age buckling loads of long columns. Knowledge of Poisson's ratio is needed in slab analysis. The variation of these physical property parameters with time of cure is investigated. Time-dependent variational trends of physical property development at early ages have not been clearly established , especially during the critical first 3 days after casting. A thorough review of literature on this subject is presented by Oluokun (2). EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE Fabrication of Test Specimens Four series of test specimens were cast using Type I cement that satisfied the requirements of ASTM C 150. Aggregates were selected in accordance with the specifications of ASTM C 33. Three of the four series were laboratory mixes prepared in a 7.5-ft 3 capacity mixer, and one was a precast, prestressed concrete producer sample. The 28-day compressive strengths of the concrete mixes used ranged from approximately 4,000 psi to approximately 9,000 psi. The specimens for each series were cast from a single batch of concrete. Standard 6-x 12-in. plastic molds were used in accordance with ASTM C 470, and molding was done according to the specifications of ASTM C 31. The coarse aggregate used was ASTM No. 67 with 100 percent of the crushed stone less than 1 in.; 90 to 100 percent was about % in. The fine aggregate used was crushed limestone. Mix proportions are shown in Table 1.},

   abstract = {Key Points: • Surrogate approximation error can introduce bias to surrogate-based inverse modeling • We propose two strategies to quantify the surrogate approximation error and improve simulation accuracy • The surrogate approximation error is gradually reduced to a small level in the high posterior density region Abstract Bayesian inverse modeling is important for a better understanding of hydrological processes. However, this approach can be computationally demanding as it usually requires a large number of model evaluations. To address this issue, one can take advantage of surrogate modeling techniques. Nevertheless, when approximation error of the surrogate model is neglected, the inversion result will be biased. In this paper, we develop a surrogate-based Bayesian inversion framework that explicitly quantifies and gradually reduces the approximation error of the surrogate. Specifically, two strategies are proposed to quantify the surrogate error. The first strategy works by quantifying the surrogate prediction uncertainty with a Bayesian method, while the second strategy uses another surrogate to simulate and correct the approximation error of the primary surrogate. By adaptively refining the surrogate over the posterior distribution, we can gradually reduce the surrogate approximation error to a small level. Demonstrated with three case studies involving high-dimensionality, multi-modality and a real-world application, it is found that both strategies can reduce the bias introduced by surrogate approximation error, while the second strategy that integrates two methods (i.e., polynomial chaos expansion and Gaussian process in this work) that complement each other shows the best performance.},

Mineral additives such as silica fume (SF), blast furnace slag (BFS), and fly ash (FA) have been used extensively in production of high performance concrete in the last decades. The mineral additives such as fly ash and blast furnace slag will reduce the hydration heat during the hardening phase, and the mineral additives also have significant influence on the development of mechanic and viscoelastic properties at early age. Within the NOR-CRACK project, extensive test programs were performed to investigate the material properties related to cracking risk of early-age concrete containing mineral additives. In current paper, the advanced modeling of the heat of hydration, volume changes (autogenous shrinkage and thermal dilation) during hardening, the development of mechanical properties (E-modulus, compressive strength, and tensile strength), and creep/relaxation properties are discussed. Tests were performed in "temperature stress testing machine" (TSTM) to measure the restraint stress, and well-documented material models were verified by performing 1-D analysis of restraint stress development in the TSTM (Ji, 2008).},

However, conventional image-based methods need extract crack features using complex image preprocessing techniques, so it can lead to challenges when concrete surface contains various types of noise due to extensively varying real-world situations such as thin cracks, rough surface, shadows, etc. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an image-based crack detection method using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN is designed through modifying AlexNet and then trained and validated using a built database with 60000 images. Through comparing validation accuracy under different base learning rates, 0.01 was chosen as the best base learning rate with the highest validation accuracy of 99.06%, and its training result is used in the following testing process. The robustness and adaptability of the trained CNN are tested on 205 images with 3120 × 4160 pixel resolutions which were not used for training and validation. The trained CNN is integrated into a smartphone application to mobile more public to detect cracks in practice. The results confirm that the proposed method can indeed detect cracks in images from real concrete surfaces.},

The motivation for the study is the need for predicting the delayed strains and the pre-stress loss of concrete containment buildings of nuclear power plants. Two subjects are central in this regard: the creep strain's long-term evolution and the creep Poisson's ratio. A greater understanding of these areas is necessary to ensure reliable predictions of the long-term behavior of the concrete containment buildings. Long-term basic creep appears to evolve as a logarithm function of time in the range of 3 to 10 years of testing. Similar trends are observed for drying creep, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage testing, which suggests that all delayed strains obtained using different loading and drying conditions originate from a common mechanism. The creep Poisson's ratio derived from the biaxial tests is approximately constant over time for both the basic and drying creep tests (creep strains corrected by the shrinkage strain). It is also shown that the biaxial non-drying samples undergo a significant increase in Young's modulus after 10 years.},

Autogenous deformation is also measured with a new shrinkage testing set-up developed at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Following the experimental results it appears that a time-zero equal to the final setting is the most adequate choice for classic concretes.

It is shown that the load–displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method.

   abstract = {This study presents experimental results on the shrinkage behavior of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), including the shrinkage development pattern, the calculation of autogenous shrinkage strain and the steel fiber restraining effect. UHPC is found to exhibit a multi-stage shrinkage characteristic. During the first two dormant stages, shrinkage is mainly composed of thermal contraction when limited hydration reaction occurs. Rapid shrinkage development commences once hydration is accelerated, leading to pore moisture depletion and pore refinement. In the later stage, shrinkage gradually levels off due to the decreasing hydration reactivity and the stiffening matrix. Autogenous shrinkage is separated by the removal of thermal strain based on the knowledge of coefficient of thermal deformation (CTD). This leads to the appearance of a transient swelling segment which may be attributed to the formation of Ca(OH)2 and ettringite crystals generating expansive stresses. Addition of steel fibers is found to reduce the shrinkage strain significantly. Its shrinkage restraining effect is a result of the matrix-fiber interfacing bonding and is numerically characterized by a mathematical model with the volume fraction and geometrical features of steel fibers as the major variables.},

The current study proposes a crack detection method based on deep fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation on concrete crack images. Performance of three different pre-trained network architectures, which serves as the FCN encoder's backbone, is evaluated for image classification on a public concrete crack dataset of 40,000 227 × 227 pixel images. Subsequently, the whole encoder-decoder FCN network with the VGG16-based encoder is trained end-to-end on a subset of 500 annotated 227 × 227-pixel crack-labeled images for semantic segmentation. The FCN network achieves about 90% in average precision. Images extracted from a video of a cyclic loading test on a concrete specimen are used to validate the proposed method for concrete crack detection. It was found that cracks are reasonably detected and crack density is also accurately evaluated.},

   abstract = {Autogenous deformation under restrained conditions often leads to cracking and durability problems in concrete structures. It is therefore important to monitor accurately the early age development of autogenous deformation. However, its expression depends strongly on the measuring methods and on the choice of the time-zero. In order to determine the effect of slag on the evolution of autogenous deformation, a test rig was designed to monitor this deformation for three concretes with different slag content. The choice of different time-zero was also discussed based on different methods: setting evolution, time of peak expansion and evolution of deformation rate. Moreover, their restrained shrinkage was studied by means of a Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM). Following these experiments, the slag cement concretes crack later than the Portland cement concrete despite the fact that they are characterized by a larger autogenous shrinkage. This behavior is mainly due to the expansion of their cement matrix at early age and their largest capacity to relax internal stresses. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The results presented in this study demonstrate the effect of varying relative humidity, water-to-cement ratios, and cement type on the creep properties of hardened cement paste as determined by microindentation. Water vapor sorption and XRD/Rietveld analysis were used to characterize the tested cement paste samples. Multi-scale analysis was also applied to downscale the creep properties of the cement paste to that of the C-S-H gel. When the drying relative humidity decreased, the specific surface area decreased whereas the bulk modulus of the C-S-H gel increased. This increase of creep modulus may be explained by the sliding of C-S-H sheets as lubricated by water molecules. Drying reduces the specific surface area, resulting in increased difficulty in the sliding of C-S-H sheets; hence, the creep modulus increases.},

Then, aging is induced by the progressive dissolution of the unhydrated particles and the precipitation of hydrates at the expense of the capillary porosity. Eventually, these new estimates are extensively compared to 380 published experimental results of basic creep tests gathered in the NU database, thus showing that the method is operational, versatile and reasonably accurate.

   abstract = {Accurate quantification of early-age tensile creep is vital to determine the stress build-up and the related crack sensitivity of concrete structures. Performing tensile creep testing in concrete is a challenging task and therefore reliable test data reported in literature is rather limited. The available test data indicates a large scatter and there is no consensus in the scientific community regarding early-age basic creep in tension. Besides, most of the prediction models in design codes are mainly calibrated using long-term compressive creep test data and their capabilities for predicting early-age tensile creep remain questionable. This paper first presents a comprehensive set of test data on early-age tensile creep of high-performance concrete using two unique methods, namely a Temperature Stress Testing Machine and a direct tensile test setup. The reliability of the collected data is demonstrated through the good agreement between the test data generated by these two test setups. Autogenous shrinkage measurements are performed simultaneously and used for determining basic tensile creep profiles. The governing factors affecting tensile creep including loading age, strength and temperature are experimentally explored in depth. The limitations of the widely utilized basic creep prediction model in the fib Model Code 2010 are identified. Based on the newly measured test data, modifications to the existing model are proposed. The proposed model better reflects not only the data collected in this study, but also that in other published data, thereby highlighting the capabilities of this model for accurate assessment of early-age basic tensile creep of high-performance concrete.},

There is a general agreement about the existence of a relationship between autogenous shrinkage and RH changes in hardening cement paste. An improved hygrometer method was developed for monitoring the change of internal RH in cement pastes 1 h after casting. This provides immediate experimental results of RH change for determining the “time-zero”. It indicates that the internal RH of cement pastes does not decrease immediately after the final setting time. A new “time-zero” is defined as the onset of internal RH drop, which is more reasonable for estimating the cracking potential of cement-based materials, compared to the “time-zero” represented by the final setting time.},

The model is based on a multiphase porous media framework, using the Thermodynamically Constrained Averaging Theory (TCAT) as starting point to derive the governing equations of the system. This allows for a systematic treatment of the multiscale properties of concrete and how these develop during hydration, e.g. chemical and physical fixation of water.

Drying shrinkage and drying creep, which is treated as a load-induced shrinkage, are combined into total drying strains while still accounting for aging through solidification.

This technique, when implemented in a finite-element model and assuming that the concrete and steel reinforcement act as a composite material, is computationally advantageous compared with explicitly modeling the concrete and steel materials separately. The method is developed assuming linear viscoelasticity and uncracked sections. The approach starts by first approximating the creep compliance functions for the viscoelastic concrete as a Kelvin chain model. This approximation allows the viscoelastic behavior to be framed as a rate-type creep law, which converts the analysis to an equivalent elastic problem, simplifying the computations. This approach, originally developed for plain concrete, is extended in this paper to account for the effects of linear elastic reinforcement. Several implementation examples are provided documenting the viability of the method for problems of uniaxial, multiaxial, and bending behaviors. For the presented cases, the composite method is shown to provide similar results compared with models containing explicitly modeled reinforcement. The paper concludes with a discussion regarding how to extend the methodology to the general case with linear viscoelastic reinforcement and matrix materials.},

   abstract = {Monitoring the evolution of an early age set of parameters on concrete is necessary to predict the early age behaviour of structures. The difficulty lies in the fact that this monitoring must be automatic because the concrete hardening process takes place over a long period after the casting. This paper presents a new methodology and an apparatus, specifically designed at IFSTTAR, to monitor the hardening process of a concrete. Mainly, the Young's modulus can be monitored in compression. Measurements start soon after having cast the concrete and the sample temperature is completely controlled so that the concrete maturity is well mastered. The performances of this apparatus, obtained on an ordinary concrete, are compared to more classical measurements using an extensometer mounted on the sample just after the setting time and to ultrasonic measurements. In these cases, the temperatures were not controlled and results have to be expressed in equivalent time. A comparison with another method developed and used at ULB by using the same concrete, in the frame of a joined cooperation between our two laboratories is achieved. This test set up is based on the so called Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM). This device has been specifically designed with a control of the concrete maturity by the use of a dummy specimen only submitted to free deformations (thermal, shrinkage). The TSTM allows compressive and tensile testing starting just after the setting time. In addition, concrete properties, such as compressive and tensile strength, have been characterized at early age. These values have been used for the design of the loading histories applied in the automatic tests. The heat released by the cement hydration has also been measured in order to express the results on a maturity scale. © 2013 RILEM.},

   abstract = {Many prestressed concrete bridges are reported to suffer from excessive vertical deflections and cracking during their service life. Creep softens the structure significantly, and therefore an accurate prediction of creep is necessary to determine long-term deflections in elements under eccentric axial compression such as prestressed concrete girders. This study proposes a modification to the creep damage model of Model Code 2010 to account for the effect of load eccentricity. The modified creep model considers damage due to differential drying shrinkage. Initially, the creep behaviour of small scale concrete specimens under eccentric compression load is investigated experimentally. Twelve small-scale concrete prisms were subjected to eccentric axial loading to assess their shrinkage and creep behaviour. The main parameters investigated include the load eccentricity and exposure conditions. Based on the experimental results, an inverse analysis is conducted to determine the main parameters of the modified creep model. Subsequently, a numerical hygro-mechanical simulation is carried out to examine the effect of load eccentricity on the development of shrinkage and creep, and on the interaction between drying, damage and creep. The results indicate that eccentric loading leads to different tensile and compressive creep through the cross section, which contradicts the current design approach that assumes that tensile and compressive creep are identical. The proposed model also predicts accurately the long-term behaviour of tests on reinforced concrete elements available in the literature. This study contributes towards further understanding of the long-term behaviour of concrete structures, and towards the development of advanced creep models for the design/assessment of concrete structures.},

   abstract = {It has been shown in a companion paper that the permeability of a porous body can be found from a three-point bending experiment. When the sample is bent, a pressure gradient is created in the liquid within the pores; as the liquid flows in response to the gradient, the force that must be applied to the rod to sustain a fixed deflection decreases with time. By fitting the force decay curve to the predicted shape, the permeability is obtained, along with the elastic modulus. In this paper, that theory is tested using porous Vycor glass saturated with various solvents, including several normal alcohols, water, and glycerol. The shape of the measured decay is in excellent agreement with the prediction. Consistent with observations of previous workers, we find that the permeability is influenced by the size of the solvent molecule; by assuming that the pore surfaces are covered with a monolayer of immobile solvent, the observed variation can be explained. The advantage of the beam-bending method is that the results are obtained in a few minutes; moreover, there is no problem with leaks or need for high pressures, as there is in conventional measurements of low permeabilities.},

However, conventional creep measurements require a large number of tests to predict the restrained creep as it is influenced by the combined effects of variable temperature, creep recovery, and varying compression and tension stresses. In this work, a double feedback control method for temperature stress testing was developed to measure the early-age restrained creep of concrete. The results demonstrate that the conventional single feedback control method neglects the effect of restrained elastic deformation, thus providing a larger-than-actual creep measurement. The tests found that the double feedback control method eliminates the influence of restrained elastic deformation. The creep results from the double feedback method match well with results from the single feedback method after compensation for the effects of restrained elastic deformation is accounted for. The difference in restrained creep between the single and double feedback methods is significant for concrete with a low modulus of elasticity but can be neglected in concrete with a high modulus of elasticity. The ratio between creep and free deformation was found to be 40-60% for low, moderate, and high strength concretes alike. The double feedback control method is therefore recommended for determining the restrained creep using a temperature stress testing machine.},

Given this, a temperature rise inhibited and slight expansion mixture (HME) was adopted in a large scale cast in situ tunnel under water. Results indicate that HME decreased the hydration rate of cement in the acceleration period and prolonged the main heat release peak. The early age rate of adiabatic temperature rise was decreased with a negligible level effect on the final value after using HME. In this case, the peak temperature could be decreased under a certain heat dissipation condition. Meanwhile, HME could reduce shrinkage deformation not only in the temperature rise stage but also in the entire process. The reduction of compressive strength affected by using HME instead of cement and its regulation on cement hydration could be further reduced to a negligible level at later ages. The first sidewall and roof have been casted more than five months and no penetrating crack and leakage were observed, which means that the double regulation on temperature and deformation technology provides a feasible and effective approach to prevent the penetrating crack of cast in situ tunnel concrete at early age.},

Small cylindrical samples of cement paste are cast with steel rods of different diameters in their centre. The rods restrain the autogenous shrinkage of the paste and may cause crack formation. The crack pattern is identified by impregnation with gallium and analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In this study, a non-linear numerical analysis of the samples was performed. Autogenous strain, elastic modulus, fracture energy, and creep as a function of hydration time were used as inputs in the analysis.

   abstract = {This article presents an experimental comparative study of the early-age behavior of binary and ternary cementitious matrices, combining Portland cement (PC), ground granulated blast furnace slag (BFS) and limestone filler (LF). The objective of this work was to quantify the influence of the composition of various blended binders on their physico-chemical evolution and early-age autogenous cracking risk. For this purpose, measurements of the rate of reactions, chemical shrinkage, autogenous shrinkage in free and restrained conditions and mechanical performances were performed on 12 binders prepared with the same water-to-cementitious materials ratio (w/cm = 0.32) and various dosages of PC, BFS and LF. The result analysis showed that the dilution effect reduced the early-age chemical shrinkage while the filler effect and the slag reactions tended to accelerate its development after a few hours of hydration. The substitution of PC with BFS and LF also led to both refining the 28-days pore size distribution measured by mercury intrusion and increasing the magnitude of early-age free autogenous shrinkage. However, in spite of their higher autogenous shrinkage potential, the binary and ternary binders very often exhibited later autogenous cracking ages than the control Portland cement paste. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Deep learning-based structural damage detection methods overcome the limitation of inferior adaptability caused by extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes). However, most deep learning-based methods detect structural damage at the image level and grid-cell level. To provide pixel-level detection of multiple damages, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)-based multiple damages detection method for concrete structure is proposed. To realize this method, a database of 2,750 images (with 504 × 376 pixels) including crack, spalling, efflorescence, and hole images in concrete structure is built, and the four damages included in those images are labeled manually. Then, the architecture of the FCN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this database. A strategy of model-based transfer learning is used to initialize the parameters of the FCN during the training process. The results show 98.61% pixel accuracy (PA), 91.59% mean pixel accuracy (MPA), 84.53% mean intersection over union (MIoU), and 97.34% frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU). Subsequently, the robustness and adaptability of the trained FCN model is tested and the damage is extracted, where damage areas are provided according to a calibrated relation between the ratio (the pixel area and true area of the detected object) and the distance from the smartphone to the concrete surface using a laser range finder. A comparative study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed FCN-based approach using a SegNet-based method. The results show that the proposed method substantiates quite better performance and can indeed detect multiple concrete damages at the pixel level in realistic situations.},

   abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of metakaolin (MK)in mitigating the autogenous shrinkage of alkali-activated slag (AAS). It is found that the autogenous shrinkage of AAS paste can be reduced by 40% and 50% when replacing 10% and 20% slag with MK, respectively. By providing additional Si and Al, and decreasing the pH of the pore solution, the incorporation of MK retards the formation of aluminium-modified calcium silicate hydrate (CASH)gels, the main reaction products in the studied pastes. The chemical shrinkage and pore refinement are consequently mitigated, resulting in a substantial reduction in the pore pressure. Meanwhile, the elastic modulus of AAS paste is only slightly influenced after MK addition. As a result, the autogenous shrinkage of AAS is significantly mitigated by incorporating MK. In addition, the introduction of MK would extend the setting time, slightly decrease the compressive strength, but greatly increase the flexural strength of AAS.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study is to solve the large-scale dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model using a simulation-based framework, which is computationally a challenging problem. Many studies have been performed on developing an efficient algorithm to solve DTA. Most of the existing algorithms are based on path-swapping descent direction methods. From the computational standpoint, the main drawback of these methods is that they cannot be parallelized. This is because the existing algorithms need to know the results of the last iteration to determine the next best path flow for the next iteration. Thus, their performance depends on the single initial or intermediate solution, which means they exploit a solution that satisfies the equilibrium conditions more than explore the solution space for the optimal solution. More specifically, the goal of this study is to overcome the drawbacks of serial algorithms by using meta-heuristic algorithms known to be parallelizable and that have never been applied to the simulation-based DTA problem. This study proposes two new solution methods: a new extension of the simulated annealing and an adapted genetic algorithm. With parallel simulation, the algorithm runs more simulations in comparison with existing methods, but the algorithm explores the solution space better and therefore obtains better solutions in terms of closeness to the optimal solution and computation time compared to classical methods.},

   abstract = {The Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is well established in such a way that engineers are very confident with the determination of the stress field or deflections of the elastic beam based on this theory. In contrast, Timoshenko theory is not so much used by engineers. However, in some cases, Euler–Bernoulli theory, which neglects the effect of transversal shear deformation, yields unacceptable results. For instance, when dealing with visco-elastic behavior, shear deformations play a fundamental role. Recent studies on the response evaluation of a visco-elastic Euler–Bernoulli beam under quasi-static and dynamic loads have been stressed that for better capturing of the visco-elastic behavior, a fractional constitutive law has to be considered. In this context, it has been provided that if the homogeneous beam correspondence principle also holds, then the study of a fractional visco-elastic Euler–Bernoulli beam may be derived from the elastic one. As mentioned before, when dealing with visco-elasticity the Timoshenko beam model is more appropriate than Euler–Bernoulli’s one, and this paper provides important information to engineering designers, introducing exact linking relationships between elastic Euler–Bernoulli beam response and fractional visco-elastic Timoshenko beam response. Ready-to-use tables and a straightforward formulation have been provided leading to significant analysis cost savings and improved quality.},

Mineral additives and amount by weight of total binder used in the blended cements are fly ash (25%), ground granulated blast furnace slag (25%), and silica fume (10%). The properties investigated include tensile creep, elastic modulus, split tensile strength, and autogenous shrinkage. The relaxation modulus used for stress prediction was obtained from the creep data fitted using a log-power creep function. These findings show that tensile creep and stress relaxation are important properties of Portland cement concrete. These properties however are reduced in con-cretes containing blended cements. Blended cements affect the early age strength and elastic modulus moderately but significantly alter the autogenous deformation. Water/cement ratio (w/c), type and dosage of mineral additives were found to influence the magnitude of auto-genous deformation. This deformation was found to be significant in low water-cement ratio concretes and should be included in early age stress calculations.

Both thermo-mechanical and fracture behaviors are studied, providing a deep insight into the hydration process. This work makes an important step in understanding the effects of hydration on the performance of cement-based materials. More specifically, in the first part, the shrinkage and fracture properties of a non-reinforced concrete have been experimentally considered, along with the characterization of several material parameters. The experimental results exhibit a high risk of early-age cracking for this kind of concrete. Especially, the fracture phenomena are complex, including multi-evolution-stages, initiation, propagation, stop-growing, and re-growing. In the second part, the computational modeling based on the phase field method of failure mechanism is applied to simulate the thermal, mechanical and fracture behavior due to early-age hydration. A detailed discussion on the identification of model/material parameters and the construction of numerical model including the boundary conditions is given. We provide the following comparison between predictions of the numerical simulation with the experimental observations. An excellent predictive capability of the computational model is noted. More importantly, this work demonstrates the performance of the proposed approach, which requires only a few tests to identify the model inputs. Most of the chemo-thermal parameters can be theoretically determined based on the concrete mix and the chemical/mineral compositions of the cement.},

   abstract = {Synopsis: The present paper * presents in chapter 1 a model for the characterization of concrete creep and shrinkage in design of concrete structures (Model B3), which is simpler, agrees better with the experimental data and is better theoretically justified than the previous models. The model complies with the general guidelines recently formulated by RILEM TC-107ß1. Justifications of various aspects of the model and diverse refinements are given in Chapter 2, and many simple explanations are appended in the commentary at the end of Chapter 1 (these parts do not to be read by those who merely want to apply the model). The prediction model B3 is calibrated by a computerized data bank comprising practically all the relevant test data obtained in various laboratories throughout the world. The coefficients of variation of the deviations of the model from the data are distinctly smaller than those for the latest CEB model (1990), and much smaller than those for the previous model in ACI 209 (which was developed in the mid-1960's). The model is simpler than the previous models (BP and BP-KX) developed at Northwestern University, yet it has comparable accuracy and is more rational. The effect of concrete composition and design strength on the model parameters is the main source of error of the model. A method to reduce this error by updating one or two model parameters on the basis of short-time creep tests is given. The updating of model parameters is particularly important for high-strength concretes and other special concretes containing various admix-tures, superplasticizers, water-reducing agents and pozzolanic materials. For the updating of shrinkage prediction, a new method in which the shrinkage half-time is calibrated by simultaneous measurements of water loss is presented. This approach circumvents the large sensitivity of the shrinkage extrapolation problem to small changes in the material parameters. The new model allows a more realistic assessment of the creep and shrinkage effects in concrete structures, which significantly affect the durability and long-time serviceability of civil engineering infrastructure. * Submitted in 1995 as a report to ACI Committee 209, Creep and Shrinkage of Concrete , which voted a unanimous approval except for one opposing vote.},

   abstract = {Concrete is one of the most widely used materials in modern civil engineering construction. Concrete creep is traditionally defined to be a kind of time-dependent behavior exhibited by concrete under sustained constant loads. In this article, a new method is proposed to test the short-term creep of concrete and the deformation state after unloading process. The test results indicate that after loading, regardless of whether the constant load is sustained or not, the specimen exhibits a hysteretic recovery after unloading, which challenges the traditional definition of concrete creep. In addition, we first observed that the fundamental time-dependent strains of concrete, which can be separated from concrete creep under sustained load, could peak in several minutes and begin to fall. The long-term creep mainly results from unrecoverable deformation, which arises as the recoverable deformation is gradually transformed into unrecoverable deformation through micro-damage accumulation. The hysteretic recovery and time-dependent behaviors which were discovered reveal the fundamental viscoelastic origin of concrete creep.},

   abstract = {Measurement of the response of a saturated body to mechanical and thermal strains can be used to determine the permeability and viscoelastic properties of the body. For example, bending a saturated beam creates a pressure gradient in the pores, and as the liquid flows to equilibrate the pressure, the force required to sustain a fixed deflection decreases. Analysis of the kinetics of force relaxation yields the permeability, in addition to the elastic modulus of the body; if viscoelastic relaxation of the solid phase occurs, it can also be measured. This method permits measurement of very low permeabilities in minutes or hours, but it is useful only for structurally homogeneous materials (such as cement paste) that can be formed into slender beams. For concrete, it is more practical to find the permeability by analysis of thermal expansion kinetics. When a saturated body is heated, the liquid expands more than the solid, and the expansion of the liquid stretches the solid network like a spring; consequently, the apparent thermal expansion coefficient is high. During an isothermal hold, the solid phase squeezes the liquid out of the pores and the body contracts. Analysis of the kinetics of thermal dilatation yields the permeability of the body. Recent experiments reveal an anomalously high thermal expansion coefficient for the water confined in the small pores of cement paste.

   abstract = {R 15 S U M E At the Magnel Laboratory for Concrete Research, University of Ghent, Belgium, an extensive experimental programme was set up in order to study the basic creep behaviour of early age concrete. Tests were carried out for a loading age ranging from 12 hours to 14 days, with two different stress levels: 20% and 40% of the compressive strength at the age of loading. Three different cement types were considered: one Portland cement and two blast furnace slag cements. Based on the experimental results a new fundamental model is proposed. The basic creep evolution is completely related to the evolution of the degree of hydration. Time is no longer an explicit parameter. The stress-strain non-linearity of the basic creep is correlated with the stress-strain non-linearity of the instantaneous deformation at loading. Furthermore, based on the fundamental basic creep model and following the principles of the equivalent time method a new degree of hydration based formulation for the early age basic creep under varying stresses is developed: the fictitious degree of hydration method. Simulations of experimental results show that this new method provides a good alternative for the traditional superposition method.

In order to be enrolled in different civil engineering applications, several properties must be characterized. This study focuses on their cracking risk by shrinkage restraints. The current paper summarizes the experimental and numerical results of a project assessing the development of early age properties of an alkali-activated slag mortar. First, an experimental campaign was held in order to quantify hydration heat release and hydration kinetics, to determine the time evolution of the Young modulus and the tensile strength and to measure free shrinkage strains, all in autogenous conditions. Second, two modelling approaches for mechanical properties and shrinkage development were compared. The results showed that the classical approach to characterize the hydration kinetics based on semi-adiabatic calorimetry results isn't suitable for the studied binder because of slow hydration and low heat release. Numerical work was finally conducted in order to predict stress development of a massive structure of alkali-activated slag mortar subjected to internal (self) and external strains' restraints (at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales).},

Generally, AD in concrete is modelled by model codes or measured in the laboratory under 20 °C isothermal conditions, and then used as basis for stress calculations under realistic temperature conditions. To evaluate this common simplification, the current study investigated the effect of curing temperature on the AD of a series of fly ash concretes. A comprehensive test program was performed for fly ash concretes subjected to various temperature curing conditions. The model codes and measurements under 20 °C isothermal conditions provided AD developments in the same order of magnitude. However, when subjected to a realistic temperature history during curing, major changes in the AD developments were observed, emphasising that AD must be determined under relevant temperature conditions.},

   abstract = {Alkali-activated slag (AAS) binders show in general larger autogeneous shrinkage strains than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based binders. However, AAS can be a relevant alternative to OPC, if, for example low hydration heat release and fine pores, are required. This study proposes an evaluation of the advantage of using AAS materials in small-sized or massive structures with regard to cracking risk by autogeneous shrinkage and thermal strains. A cracking risk index is calculated; this risk is defined as the ratio between stress generated by full restraint and tensile strength. All required experimental data were investigated in an OPC and AAS mortar, these are: heat release, autogeneous shrinkage, Young’s modulus, tensile strength and basic creep evolutions. The material parameters of a rate-dependent model developed in 1D were then identified. Numerical simulations were then performed for different thicknesses in full-restraint conditions. These show that, as expected, basic creep is a very important material parameter to assess. Indeed, basic creep enables the significant reduction of the generated stresses. Besides, it is found that the more the structure is large (and sensitive to cracking by risk by thermal strain), the more the AAS material is becoming appropriate compared to the OPC material.},

The epoxy impregnation in concrete sample can prevent damage to the microstructure during polishing process for obtaining the flat surface. However, further exploration about the effect of epoxy impregnation on characterizing the properties of concrete has not been found. In this paper, the vacuum impregnation method is adopted to prepare the epoxy impregnated concrete and paste samples. The aspects of microscopic properties of impregnated and non-impregnated samples are evaluated and compared in terms of the surface elevation, the indentation modulus, and the thickness of the interfacial transition zone between the aggregate and the paste matrix (ITZagg-paste) as well as that between the residual C3S clinker and the hydration product (ITZC3S-HP). The techniques of optical microscope, backscattered electron microscope, scanning probe microscope (SPM) modulus mapping, and the instrumented indentation are adopted to measure the above microproperties. The results show that the epoxy impregnation is favoured in the microscope image analysis, nanoindentation measurement, and characterizing the ITZC3S-HP by SPM modulus mapping. It is not recommended for characterizing the thickness of ITZagg-paste by SPM modulus mapping and for measuring the micromechanical properties at the paste scale by microindentation.},

It is shown that the corresponding Timoshenko viscoelastic functions now depend not only on material properties and geometry as they do in elasticity, but also additionally on stresses and their time histories. Possible viscoelastic definitions are formulated and evaluated. In general, the viscoelastic relations are sufficiently complicated so that the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle (analogy) cannot be applied. This is particularly true for, but not limited to, elastic shear coefficients which are Poisson ratio dependent. Expressions for equivalent viscoelastic Timoshenko shear functions must, therefore, be derived de novo on a case by case basis, taking in to account specific relaxation moduli, stresses, temperatures and their time histories. Thus the elastic simplicity and generality is lost and hence rendering the use of viscoelastic Timoshenko shear functions as highly impractical. Consequently, it is necessary to directly solve the coupled viscoelastic beam governing relations for bending and twisting deflections by using appropriate solution protocols as discussed herein. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, B.

The results from the standard tests are used to assess and to improve formulas of the fib Model Code 2010: the correlation formula between the 28-day values of the strength and the stiffness, and the evolution formulas describing the early-age evolution of the strength and the stiffness during the first four weeks after production. The results from the innovative tests are used to develop a correlation formula between the 28-day values of Young's modulus and the creep modulus, and an evolution formula describing the early-age evolution of the creep modulus during the first four weeks after production. Particularly, the analyzed CEM I concretes develop stiffness and strength significantly faster than described by the formulas of the Model Code. The creep modulus of the investigated concretes evolves significantly slower than their strength and stiffness. Thus, concrete loaded at early ages is surprisingly creep active, even if the material appears to be quite mature in terms of its strength and stiffness.},

This study investigates different approaches to estimate the time-zero for cement paste mixtures with and without superabsorbent polymers as internal curing agents. The initial and final setting times were determined by an electronic Vicat and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements (UPV); the transition point between the fluid and solid state was determined from the autogenous strain curve; the development of the capillary pressure was also studied. The choice of time-zero before the transition point led to higher values of shrinkage strain that should not be taken into account for autogenous shrinkage. A negligible difference was found between the strains when the final setting time and the transition point were taken as time-zero. Considering the artefacts and practical issues involving the different methods, the use of the transition point from the autogenous strain curve is the most suitable technique for determining the time-zero.},

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can unravel underlying patterns in complex data. Accordingly, this study endeavors to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of UHPC using a comprehensive experimental database retrieved from the open literature consisting of 810 test observations and 15 input features. A novel approach based on tabular generative adversarial networks was used to generate 6513 plausible synthetic data for training robust machine learning models, including random forest, extra trees, and gradient boosting regression. While the models were trained using the synthetic data, their ability to generalize their predictions was tested on the 810 experimental data thus far unknown and never presented to the models. The results indicate that the developed models achieved outstanding predictive performance. Parametric studies using the models were able to provide insight into the strength development mechanisms of UHPC and the significance of the various influential parameters.},

The main reaction products in AAMs pastes are C-A-S-H type gel and the reaction rate decreases when slag is partially replaced by fly ash. Due to the chemical shrinkage and the fine pore structure of AAMs pastes, drastic drop of internal relative humidity is observed and large pore pressure is generated. The pore pressure induces not only elastic deformation but also a large creep of the paste. Besides the pore pressure, other driving forces, like the reduction of steric-hydration force due to the consumption of ions, also cause a certain amount of shrinkage, especially in the acceleration period. Based on the mechanisms revealed, a computational model is proposed to estimate the autogenous shrinkage of AAMs. The calculated autogenous shrinkage matches well with the measured results.},

As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98% accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

   abstract = {Many bridge structures, one of the most critical components in transportation infrastructure systems, exhibit signs of deteriorations and are approaching or beyond the initial design service life. Therefore, structural health inspections of these bridges are becoming critically important, especially after extreme events. To enhance the efficiency of such an inspection, in recent years, autonomous damage detection based on computer vision has become a research hotspot. This article proposes a three-level image-based approach for post-disaster inspection of the reinforced concrete bridge using deep learning with novel training strategies. The convolutional neural network for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are, respectively, proposed to conduct system-level failure classification, component-level bridge column detection, and local damage-level damage localization. To enable efficient training and prediction using a small data set, the model robustness is a crucial aspect to be taken into account, generally through its hyperparameters’ selection. This article, based on Bayesian optimization, proposes a principled manner of such selection, with which very promising results (well over 90% accuracies) and robustness are observed on all three-level deep learning models.},

   abstract = {This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based response estimation model for structural health monitoring (SHM) of tall buildings subject to wind loads. In this model, the wind-induced responses are estimated by CNN trained with previously measured sensor signals; this enables the SHM system to operate stably even when a sensor fault or data loss occurs. In the presented model, top-level wind-induced displacement in the time and frequency domains, and wind data in the frequency domain are configured into the input map of the CNN to reflect the resisting capacity of a tall building, the change in the dynamic characteristics of the building due to wind loads, and the relationship between wind load and the building. To evaluate stress, which is used as a safety indicator for structural members in the building, the maximum and minimum strains of columns are set as the output layer of the CNN. The CNN is trained using measured wind and wind response data to predict the column strains during a future wind load. The presented model is validated using data from a wind tunnel test of a building model. The performance of the presented model is verified through strain estimation with data that were not used in the CNN training. To assess the validity of the presented input map configuration, the estimation performance is compared with a CNN that considered only the time domain responses as input. Furthermore, the effects of the variations in the configuration of the CNN on the wind response estimation performance are examined.},

The implementation of the proposed methodology allows damage identification and localization within a realistic large-scale system. To validate the proposed method, first, a well-known benchmark model is numerically simulated. Using acceleration response histories, as well as compressed response data in terms of discrete histograms, CNN models are trained, and the robustness of the CNN architectures is evaluated. Finally, pretrained CNNs are fine-tuned to be adaptable for three-parameter, extremely compressed response data, based on the response mean, standard deviation, and a scale factor. The performance of each CNN implementation is assessed using training accuracy histories as well as confusion matrices, along with other performance metrics. In addition to the numerical study, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using experimental vibration response data for verification and validation. The results indicate that deep TL can be implemented effectively for SHM of similar structural systems with different types of sensors.},

Further, taking advantages of the Mellin transform method recently developed for the solution of fractional differential equation, the problem of fractional Timoshenko beam model is assessed in time domain without invoking the Laplace-transforms as usual. Further, solution provided by the Mellin transform procedure will be compared with classical Central Difference scheme one, based on the Grunwald-Letnikov approximation of the fractional derivative. Moreover, Timoshenko beam response is generally evaluated by solving a couple of differential equations. In this paper, expressing the equation of the elastic curve just through a single relation, a more general procedure, which allows the determination of the beam response for any load condition and type of constraints, is developed. © 2015 John Wiley},

The restrained deformations are linked to the restraint stresses according to the Cauchy-Navier equations of elasticity, assuming an incremental stress-strain relationship. The Bresler-Pister and Rankine failure criteria are utilized to model failure. The material parameters are adapted according to the Drucker-Prager and Griffith criteria. The crack initiation and propagation is verified experimentally by X-ray radiography. Eventually, the cracking mechanism is discussed and a safe capillary pressure limit is proposed. It is found that capillary pressure stiffening occurring before air entry, when deformations take place in the saturated state, is the predominant cause of plastic shrinkage cracking in the drying state.},

The magnitude of the applied load is unambiguous when the load is monotonically increased or held constant. However, in the case of nanoindentation testing with continuous stiffness measurement (CSM), wherein an oscillatory load is superimposed on the primary load, what one should use for the load has significant implications especially for rate-dependent materials. In this work, a concept of an effective load during nanoindentation creep testing with CSM is proposed based on a theoretical analysis. The analytical model is experimentally validated, and good agreement is found with the experimental results, even when the material exhibits a strong indentation size effect (ISE). The findings of this work have important implications for accurately measuring the rate dependence of hardness, especially during high-temperature nanoindentation testing.

To accurately measure and model creep behavior of concrete considering the relative humidity effect is difficult despite more than 100 years of research of concrete creep. In this study, a test set-up was designed to measure the creep-induced deflection of concrete beams exposed to different drying conditions (sealed and symmetric drying). A numerical method is proposed to quantify the creep parameters of concrete considering the relative humidity effect. The sequential coupled hydromechanical finite element analysis was conducted to back-calculate the creep parameters in the microprestress solidification theory-based creep model from the measured creep-induced deflection. It was found that the obtained parameters are independent of the loading and drying conditions. One set of parameters can predict the creep-induced deflection of concrete beams exposed to different drying conditions. The findings in this study provide a new methodology to obtain the creep parameters which can be implemented numerically for analyzing creep behavior of various concrete structures without considering the drying-related size effect.},

The results were compared with that of the total shrinkage (including drying shrinkage and part of the autogenous shrinkage) of the concrete specimens dried in 65% relative humidity after an initial moist curing of 7 days. The water-to-cementitious materials (w/c) ratio of the concrete studied was in the range of 0.26 to 0.35 and the SF content was in the range of 0% to 10% by weight of cement. The results confirmed that the autogenous shrinkage increased with decreasing w/c ratio, and with increasing SF content. The results showed that the autogenous shrinkage strains of the concrete with low w/c ratio and SF developed rapidly even at early ages. At the w/c ratio of 0.26, the autogenous shrinkage strains of the SF concrete were more than 100 micro strains at 2 days. For all the concretes studied, 60% or more of the autogenous shrinkage strain up to 98 days occurred in the first 2 weeks after concrete casting. The results indicated that most of the total shrinkage of the concrete specimens with very low w/c ratio and SF exposed to 65% relative humidity after an initial moist curing of 7 days did not seem to be due to the drying shrinkage but due to the autogenous shrinkage. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Additionally, the direct measuring deformation method can obtain a more accurate deformation and restraint degree result with little local damage. The external temperature deformation affecting the concrete specimen can be eliminated by adopting the temperature deformation compensation method with different considerations of steel materials.

This indicates that basic creep could be expressed as a logarithmic function in which the age of loading does not affect the final slope. In the recent fib Model Code 2010 (MC2010), basic creep is expressed exactly in this way. Using experimental data, the parameters of the model are calculated for each test and compared with the values proposed by MC2010.

An adapted version of the Model Code 2010 (MC2010) is used to model basic creep.

It corresponds to the end of the second peak of hydration due to slag. After the slag peak of hydration, the basic creep is similar to ordinary Portland cement concrete with equivalent water-to-binder ratio.

Experimental results show that the creep coefficient has a negative correlation with concrete strength and ambient relative humidity, and the latter influences creep more than the former.

Under different environmental conditions, there is deviation between the tested creep coefficients and theoretical values by certainty creep models, while the experimental data are within the 95% confidence interval of CEB-FIP MC 90 model, indicating that the presented numerical method for calculating the 95% confidence interval of the creep coefficient is reliable.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to assess the influence of flash calcined dredging sediments (CFC), having pozzolanic reactivity, on the early-age hydration and autogenous deformation behaviour of blended cements, where cement is replaced by 20, 30 and 40% of CFC. The results indicate that the early-age hydration behaviour of a CFC blended cement is similar to the early-age hydration behaviour of a fly ash blended cement. Furthermore, CFC acts as an SCM that decreases autogenous shrinkage. This is attributed to an increased early-age swelling, and to the dilution effect and formation of different hydration products. The observed swelling is most probably due to the increased ettringite content and higher sulphate to alumina ratio, ensuring a crystallisation pressure as a result of supersaturation of the pore solution towards ettringite formation. Besides its pozzolanic reactivity, the decreased autogenous shrinkage that CFC is generating in blended cements, is encouraging for its use as a novel SCM that reduces early-age cracking risk of concrete, hereby improving concrete durability.},

However, it is difficult to estimate elastic modulus of concrete practically using simple models proposed so far. In this study, a numerical concrete model that adopts three-phase model and finite element with material discontinuity was proposed to analyze concrete with complex interface in three dimensions. The validity of the proposed model was verified by comparing the calculated elastic moduli of concrete with those obtained from experiments. The effect of interfacial transition zone on elastic modulus of concrete with either low or high w/c was also investigated.

The model is based on the Fourier equation of heat flow with the adiabatic hydration curve employed as a reference for simulating the hydration heat source. The proposed formulations are based on a consistent scheme for the partial differential equation and its boundary and starting conditions. The hydration kinetics is simulated through the Arrhenius approach. Formulations for the compressive strength and the elastic modulus are provided and the maturity function is also considered. A finite difference numerical solution is derived with a forward explicit time integration in the time-space domain. The numerical solution is designed as a stepwise "recipe" specifically conceived to be easily implemented by means of either a high-level programming language or even a spreadsheet tool. Experimental temperature measurements for two different mixtures, under adiabatic and semi-adiabatic conditions, are used for validating the proposed model. The adiabatic and semi-adiabatic temperature simulations show good agreement with the experimental data for both concrete mixtures. The degree of hydration could be simulated and used as the fundamental parameter for scrutinising the evolution of the compressive strength. Particularly, a linear trend between the compressive strength and the degree of hydration and the maturity was figured out. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

High shrinkage can result in potential cracking and eventually reduced strength and durability of concrete. Several approaches can be used to mitigate the autogenous shrinkage based on restraining mechanism. These include (1) control of hydration reaction; (2) addition of internal restraint; (3) reduction of the surface tension of pore solution; (4) formation of expansive products; and (5) replenishment of water through internal curing. This paper reviewed those mitigation techniques from the perspective of restraining mechanism and influential factors. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of those techniques were compared. It is indicated that internal curing is the most straightforward and effective approach to reduce autogenous shrinkage of UHPC. The combination of two and/or more techniques can simultaneously exert their functions, and thus maximizing the restraining effectiveness.},

Autogenous shrinkage was reduced in cement pastes with the supplementary cementitious materials versus Portland cement pastes.

   abstract = {The E-modulus of early age cement-based materials, and more importantly, its evolution in time, is one of the most critical material-to-structural design parameters affecting the likelihood of early-age concrete cracking. This paper addresses the problem by means of a multistep micromechanics approach that starts at the nanolevel of the C-S-H matrix, where two types of C-S-H develop in the course of hydration. For the purpose of homogenization, the volume fractions of the different phases are required, which are determined by means of an advanced kinetics model of the four main hydration reactions of ordinary portland cement (OPC). The proposed model predicts with high accuracy the aging elasticity of cement-based materials, with a minimum intrinsic material properties (same for all cement-based materials), and 11 mix-design specific model parameters that can be easily obtained from the cement and concrete suppliers. By way of application, it is shown that the model provides a quantitative means to determine (1) the solid percolation threshold from micromechanics theory, (2) the effect of inclusions on the elastic stiffening curve, and (3) the development of the Poisson's ratio at early ages. The model also suggests the existence of a critical water-to-cement ratio below which the solid phase percolates at the onset of hydration. The development of Poisson's ratio at early ages is found to be characterized by a water-dominated material response as long as the water phase is continuous, and then by a solid-dominated material response beyond the solid percolation threshold. These model-based results are consistent with experimental values for cement paste, mortar, and concrete found in the open literature. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Several composites comprise material phases that cannot be recapitulated ex situ, including calcium silicate hydrates in cementitous materials, hydroxyapatite in bone, and clay agglomerates in geomaterials. This requirement for in situ synthesis and characterization of chemically complex phases obviates conventional mechanical testing of large specimens representative of these material components. Current advances in experimental micro and nanomechanics have afforded new opportunities to explore and understand the effect of thermochemical environments on the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of naturally occurring material composites. Here, we propose a straightforward application of instrumented indentation to extract the in situ elastic properties of individual components and to image the connectivity among these phases in composites. This approach relies on a large array of nano to microscale contact experiments and the statistical analysis of the resulting data. Provided that the maximum indentation depth is chosen carefully, this method has the potential of extracting elastic properties of the indented phase which are minimally affected by the surrounding medium. An estimate of the limiting indentation depth is provided by asssuming a layered, thin film geometry. The proposed methodology is tested on a "model" composite material, a titanium-titanium monoboride (Ti-TiB) of various volumetric proportions. The elastic properties, volume fractions, and morphological arrangement of the two phases are recovered.

   abstract = {Recently there has been an increasing interest in self-healing materials which have the ability to retrieve their physico-mechanical properties once the material is damaged. This paper presents a numerical model for the self-healing capacity of cementitious composites capable of simulating the recovery of mechanical properties of the damaged (cracked) material. The recent SMM (Solidification-Microprestress-Microplane model M4) model for concrete, which makes use of a modified microplane model M4 and the solidification-microprestress theory, is able to reproduce the concrete time-dependent behavior, e.g. creep, shrinkage, thermal deformation, aging, and cracking from early age up to several years. The moisture and heat fields, as well as the hydration degree, are obtained from the solution of a hygro-thermo-chemical problem which is coupled with the SMM model. This numerical framework is extended to incorporate the self-healing effects and, in particular, the effect of delayed cement hydration, which is the main cause of the self-healing for young concrete. The new update model can also simulate the effects of cracking on the permeability and the opposite restoring effect of the self-healing on the mechanical constitutive law, i.e. the microplane model. A numerical example is presented to validate the proposed computational model employing experimental data from a recent test series undertaken at Politecnico di Milano. The experimental campaign has dealt with a normal strength concrete, in which (by means of three-point-bending tests performed up to controlled crack opening and up to failure, respectively before and after exposure to different conditioning environments) the recovery of stiffness and load bearing capacity has been evaluated.},

   abstract = {The present work reviews the implementation of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis with emphasis in four main types of metamodels: response surfaces, polynomial chaos expansions, support vector machines, and Kriging models. The discussion presented is motivated by the identified spread and little interaction between metamodeling techniques in reliability, which makes it challenging for practitioners to decide which one to consider in a context of implementation. The conceptual problem of reliability analysis and the theoretical description of the four models is presented, and complemented by a comparative discussion of applications with identification of new areas of interest. The different considerations that influence the efficiency of adaptive metamodeling are reviewed, with extension to applicability discussions for the four models researched. Despite all adaptive techniques contributing to achieve significant gains in the amount of effort required for reliability analysis, and with minimal trade-off in accuracy, they should not be expected to perform equally in regard to the dependence on the reliability problem being addressed. Cross application of methodologies, bridging the gap between methodology and application, and ensembles are some of new areas of research interest identified. One of the major critical considerations for adaptive metamodeling, and that has been target of limited research, is the need for comprehensive techniques that allow a blind selection of the most adequate model with relation to the problem in–hand. To conclude, the extensive and comprehensive discussion presented aims to be a first step for the unification of the field of adaptive metamodeling in reliability; so that future implementations do not exclusively follow individual lines of research that progressively become more narrow in scope, but also seek transversal developments in the field of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis.},

Three micromechanical models from three research groups have been adopted for modeling the basic non-aging creep of cementitious materials. The benchmark is based on the hypotheses that creep results only from calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) and that viscoelastic behavior of all microstructural constituents is maturity- and composition-independent. By comparing model results among themselves as well as by comparing model predictions with experimental results obtained from three different laboratories, we demonstrate that creep upscaling from micrometer-sized C-S-H to centimeter-sized macroscopic samples of cement paste, mortar, and concrete, and from minutes-long creep tests at early ages to days-long creep tests at very mature ages is indeed possible. The benchmark also highlights the importance of considering micro-anisotropy of C-S-H in terms of non-spherical shapes for C-S-H hydrates.},

Cracking therefore leads to a faster penetration of liquid, gaseous and aggressive agents, which may reduce the durability and the tightness of the structures. It may be caused by an external loading or else by the self- or external restraint of autogenous, drying and thermal shrinkage. This paper will focus on the latter of these phenomena. In the first part of this study (part I: Laboratory test), ring tests are performed to investigate the sensitivity of concrete to cracking due to both shrinkage strain and fibre type (two organic fibres and one steel fibre have been studied). Results obtained show that the use of polypropylene microfibres does not delay the age at which the first crack appears but does slightly reduce crack opening. Polypropylene and steel macrofibres have a greater effect since cracking is delayed and the crack opening is significantly reduced. Tensile strength results indicate that a portion of the cracking delay may be attributed to the tensile strength increase resulting from fibre reinforcement.},

For this purpose, measurements of the rate of reactions, chemical shrinkage, autogenous shrinkage in free and restrained conditions and mechanical performances were performed on 12 binders prepared with the same water-to-cementitious materials ratio (w/cm = 0.32) and various dosages of PC, BFS and LF. The result analysis showed that the dilution effect reduced the early-age chemical shrinkage while the filler effect and the slag reactions tended to accelerate its development after a few hours of hydration. The substitution of PC with BFS and LF also led to both refining the 28-days pore size distribution measured by mercury intrusion and increasing the magnitude of early-age free autogenous shrinkage. However, in spite of their higher autogenous shrinkage potential, the binary and ternary binders very often exhibited later autogenous cracking ages than the control Portland cement paste. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {In this paper, the ring test is used to determine the stress relaxation parameters of concrete in tension at early-age. Through ring test, the steel-concrete interfacial compressive stress generated from shrinkage of concrete is obtained first. Meanwhile, the theoretical value of the interfacial compressive stress is precisely calculated by a model for given shrinkage of concrete. In the model, a power function with three unknown constants was used to model the viscoelastic behavior of concrete under tension. The expected stress relaxation constants can then be determined with the condition that the difference between calculated and tested interfacial compressive stresses satisfies the required tolerance. Using this mythology, the creep relaxation parameters of three kinds of concretes with compressive strength at 28 days around 30 MPa, 50 MPa and 80 MPa are obtained. The determined stress relaxation parameters are used in the existing experimental results of shrinkage stress tests that are independently carried out and reasonable agreement between model and test data is found. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {High-performance concrete (HPC) is widely used in practice. The water-to-cement ratio of HPC is low, and self-desiccation occurs which will induce marked autogenous shrinkage. Autogenous shrinkage usually increases the risk of cracking if the concrete is restrained from shrinking freely at early age. The autogenous shrinkage and cracking resistance of early-age concrete is influenced by curing temperature. However, the effect of curing temperature on autogenous shrinkage of early-age concrete is not in consistency and how the curing temperature affects the cracking resistance of concrete remains lacking. Thus, investigation on the effect of curing temperature on cracking resistance of early age concrete must be further studied. In this study, experimental studies on early-age cracking of concrete under 100% restraint and different curing temperatures were carried out using Temperature Stress Test Machine (TSTM). The present study investigated autogenous shrinkage of early-age HPC cured at different curing temperatures. The experimental results indicate that (1) the ratios of cracking stress to tensile strength for HPC specimens were all lower than 1.0; (2) the autogenous shrinkage of HPC increased with the increase of curing temperature; (3) a prediction model for autogenous shrinkage of HPC was presented considering the effect of curing temperature; (4) cracking temperatures and stress reserves were selected as the main cracking evaluation indicators of TSTM, and the HPC specimen cured at isothermal 20 °C showed better cracking resistance than that at isothermal 45 °C and adiabatic condition.},

The driving forces behind EAC are thermal dilation and autogenous deformation, but EAC is also strongly dependent on material and geometrical properties such as hydration heat development, tensile strength, E-modulus, creep, cross-sectional dimensions, and degree of restraint. The current document contains a description of the EAC design methodology that is currently being implemented in Norway. The basis of the methodology is to define and describe the material properties of a given concrete through laboratory testing and succeeding model fitting. The obtained material parameters are then evaluated and calibrated by comparing (1) stress development measured in a Temperature-Stress Testing Machine with (2) stress development calculated by using the obtained material properties and various multiphysical EAC calculation approaches. Special consideration is given to the effect of realistic curing temperature regimes on the various material properties and consequently on the EAC.</p>},

The test involves hygro-mechanical interactions with intricate interplay of several phenomena, such as autogenous shrinkage, drying shrinkage, basic and drying creep, together with evolution of tensile strength and fracture energy. The benchmark described in this paper relies on extensive experimental data sets obtained through the extended Round Robin Testing programme (RRT+) of COST Action TU1404. Six teams took part with their simulation models. A series of outputs were produced, starting from mass loss of a prism through its axial deformation up to hoop stress/strain evolution in the ring. Four teams quantified also damage due to drying and strain concentrations. All models showed excellent performance on mass loss while strain validation showed higher scatter and influence of several factors. The benchmark demonstrated high capability of used models and emphasized strong role of calibration with regards to available experimental data.},

Classical macroscopic mass and energy conservation laws are written by using humidity and temperature as primary variables and by taking into account explicitly various chemical reactions, such as cement hydration, silica fume reaction, and silicate polymerization. The effect of cement hydration is modeled through the classical concept of hydration degree. Silica fume reaction and silicate polymerization are modeled by introducing the degree of silica fume reaction and the concentration of silicate polymers, along with their evolution laws. The present model can simulate early age phenomena, such as self-heating and self-desiccation, with great accuracy.

Where DEF risk proves to be significant, contractors are required to adopt risk mitigation strategies including lowering concrete's temperature during placement by adding cool water or ice, for example, to the mix, embedding cooling pipes in the cast element and/or sequential placement of the concrete. These strategies can be implemented at different levels, as needed, to minimise the risk of cracking and DEF. Determining the most suitable and cost-efficient risk mitigation strategy, however, together with its implementation, is a complex task that requires consideration of each complex strategy under project-specific conditions. While a significant research effort has been invested to develop an improved understanding of the effectiveness of different early age thermal cracking and DEF risk mitigation strategies, the lack of reliable models capable of simulating and comparing the effectiveness of all scenarios remains elusive and considerably limits the ability of the practitioners in identifying the optimal approach. This paper presents a Multiphysics model developed to predict the effect of early-age thermal cracking and DEF risk mitigation scenarios. The model is validated using four real-life project Case Studies and is demonstrated to provide reliable results. In addition, the paper studies the comparative effectiveness of key risk mitigation strategies and the important parameters influencing their effectiveness.},

Age-dependent viscoelastic behavior under variable hygro-thermal conditions is described according to the solidification- microprestress theory. Cracking/damage behavior is modeled through an age-dependent microplane model, in which the model parameters are assumed to be dependent on an aging variable evolving with the extent of early-age chemical reactions (hydration, silica-fume reaction, etc.) and temperature. Calibration and validation of the model is performed by the numerical simulations of the age-dependent response of sealed and unsealed specimens subject to a variety of loading conditions and/or drying.

Three ensemble machine learning (EML) models are selected in this study: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). Firstly, the creep data in Northwestern University (NU) database is preprocessed by a prebuilt XGBoost model and then split into a training set and a testing set. Then, by Bayesian Optimization and 5-fold cross validation, the 3 EML models are tuned to achieve high accuracy (R2 = 0.953, 0.947 and 0.946 for LGBM, XGBoost and RF, respectively). In the testing set, the EML models show significantly higher accuracy than the equation proposed by the fib Model Code 2010 (R2 = 0.377). Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), based on the cooperative game theories, are calculated to interpretate the predictions of the EML model. Five most influential parameters for concrete creep compliance are identified by the SHAP values of EML models as follows: time since loading, compressive strength, age when loads are applied, relative humidity during the test and temperature during the test. The patterns captured by the three EML models are consistent with theoretical understanding of factors that influence concrete creep, which proves that the proposed EML models show reasonable predictions.},

It is a physical process, having though mechanical consequences. Drying accompanies the hardening of concrete and leads to significant dimensional changes that appear as cracks. The advent or absence of cracking depends not only on the potential contraction but also on the extensibility of concrete, it' s strength (the cracking due to shrinkage appears only in case the tensile strength of concrete has been over passed by the stresses, induced by shrinkage deformations), and its degree of restraint to the deformation that may lead to cracking. These cracks influence the durability of the concrete works. This study presents the application of a nonparametric approach called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict effectively dimensional variations due to drying shrinkage.Using this approach allows to develop models for predicting shrinkage. These models use a multi layer back propagation. They depend on a very large database of experimental results issued from literature (RILEM Data Bank), and an appropriate choice of architectures and learning processes. These models take into account the different parameters of concrete preservation and making which affect drying shrinkage of concrete as: Relative humidity (RH), Cure Period, volume to surface area ratio (V/S), water to cement ratio (W/C), and fine aggregate to total aggregate ratio or sand to total aggregate ratio (S/Ta). To validate these models, they are compared with parametric models as: B3, ACI 209, CEB and GL2000. In these comparisons, it appears that ANN approach describes correctly the evolution with time of drying shrinkage. A parametric study is also conducted to quantify the degree of influence of some the different parameters used in the developed neural network model. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This study aims to provide an efficient alternative for predicting creep modulus of cement paste based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). First, a microscale lattice model for short-term creep is adopted to build a database that contains 18,920 samples. Then, 3 DCNNs with different consecutive convolutional layers are built to learn from the database. Finally, the performance of DCNNs is tested on unseen testing samples. The results show that the DCNNs can achieve high accuracy in the testing set, with the R2 all higher than 0.96. The distribution of creep modulus predicted by the DCNNs coincides with that of the original data. Furthermore, through analyzing the feature maps, it is found that the DCNNs can correctly capture the local importance of different microstructural phases. The DCNN allows therefore prediction of the creep modulus based on microstructural input, which saves computational resources of segmentation procedure and multiple incremental FEM calculations.},

   abstract = {In the present paper, the design of optimized rubber concrete composite containing silica fume (SF) and zeolite (ZE) was undertaken using the literature, and the properties were assessed through destructive and non-destructive (NDT) methods. In order to optimize the rubberized cement composite, the optimum tradeoff between compressive strength as the main objective and rubber content, as well as the optimum fractions of the admixtures were taken into account. Main tests including workability, compressive strength, elastic modulus, and ultrasonic tests were carried out to fully assess the effects of rubber, ZE, SF, curing, and age on the rubberized composite behavior. Primary and secondary wave velocities, i.e. Vp and Vs were determined from ultrasonic test to characterize different mixtures. Static modulus results obtained from NDT were compared, and it was found that NDT results were in very good agreement with those of destructive test results. Moreover, the dynamic elastic modulus determined from compression and shear wave velocities (Vp, Vs) conforming to ASTM were compared with those estimated from six different relationships including BS, EN and ACI relationships along with other well-known equations available in the literature. In order to predict the compressive strength of the rubberized cement composite as a function of the influencing variables, a comprehensive comparative modeling was performed and different predictive models were developed using regressions and machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e. nonlinear multi-variable regression (NMVR), Artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support-vector machine (SVM). Closed- form formulations were derived for NMVR, ANN, and GP models, and parametric study was conducted for ML models. Performance criteria such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to compare the models’ performance. It was found that SVM outperformed the other models with the highest R2 and the lowest RMSE equal to 0.989 and 1.393, respectively.},

   abstract = {<p>There have been abundant experimental studies exploring ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) in recent years. However, the relationships between the engineering properties of UHPC and its mixture composition are highly nonlinear and difficult to delineate using traditional statistical methods. There is a need for robust and advanced methods that can streamline the diverse pertinent experimental data available to create predictive tools with superior accuracy and provide insight into its nonlinear materials science aspects. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can unravel underlying patterns in complex data. Accordingly, this study endeavors to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of UHPC using a comprehensive experimental database retrieved from the open literature consisting of 810 test observations and 15 input features. A novel approach based on tabular generative adversarial networks was used to generate 6513 plausible synthetic data for training robust machine learning models, including random forest, extra trees, and gradient boosting regression. While the models were trained using the synthetic data, their ability to generalize their predictions was tested on the 810 experimental data thus far unknown and never presented to the models. The results indicate that the developed models achieved outstanding predictive performance. Parametric studies using the models were able to provide insight into the strength development mechanisms of UHPC and the significance of the various influential parameters.</p>},

   abstract = {Proper functioning and safety of anchor elements are decisive for the overall performance of a structural system. A possible failure mode for anchor loaded in shear is the concrete breakout failure. Concrete related failure mode poses a significant safety issue, since they may develop abruptly/brittle, without preceding signs of damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of the concrete breakout strength of anchors in shear is crucial. This study proposes two machine learning models — a Gaussian process regression (GPR) and a support vector machine (SVM) model — for predicting the concrete breakout capacity of single anchors in shear. To this end, experimental strength of 366 tests on single anchors with concrete edge breakout failures were collected from literature to establish the experimental database to train and test the models. 70% of the data were used for the model training, and the rest were used for the model testing. Shear influence factors such as the concrete strength, the anchor diameter, the embedment depth (technically the influence length), and the concrete edge distance were taken as the model input variables. The generated GPR and SVM prediction models yielded a determination coefficient R2 = 0.99 for both the training and testing data sets. Predictions from the developed models were compared to that of the other existing models (Eurocode 2, ACI 318 and Grosser) to validate their performance. The developed GPR and SVM models provided a better prediction of the experimentally observed shear strength, compared to the existing models. The predictions obtained from the GPR model are the most accurate, yielding a value of 5.6 mean absolute error when tested.},

The outcome of this analysis is a computational-based ML framework that is capable of identifying failure mode of UHPC beams and simplified expressions for predicting shear capacity of UHPC beams. Predictions obtained from the proposed framework was compared against the values obtained from design equations in codes, and also results from full-scale tests to show the reliability of the proposed approach.

Results show that the RF model – once meticulously trained, and after its hyperparameters are rigorously optimized – is able to produce high fidelity predictions of both properties of new AACs. The model is also used to quantitatively assess the influence of physiochemical attributes and process parameters on the AAC's properties.

The development of strengths prediction technique of SFRC is, however, still in its infancy compared to that of normal concrete because of its complexity and limited available data. To overcome this limitation, research was conducted to develop an optimum machine learning algorithm for predicting the compressive and flexural strengths of SFRC. The resulting feature impact was also analyzed to confirm the reliability of the models. To achieve this, compressive and flexural strengths data from SFRC were collected through extensive literature reviews, and a database was created. Eleven machine learning algorithms were then established based on the dataset. K-fold validation was conducted to prevent overfitting, and the algorithms were regulated. The boosting- and tree-based models had the optimal performance, whereas the K-nearest neighbor, linear, ridge, lasso regressor, support vector regressor, and multilayer perceptron models had the worst performance. The water-to-cement ratio and silica fume content were the most influential factors in the prediction of compressive strength of SFRC, whereas the silica fume and fiber volume fraction most strongly influenced the flexural strength. Finally, it was found that, in general, the compressive strength prediction performance was better than the flexural strength prediction performance, regardless of the machine learning algorithm.},

Two datasets containing the single-lap shear test results for FRP laminates externally bonded on concrete prisms and externally bonded on the grooves of concrete prisms are used to train the three selected ML approaches and test their performances. The predicted results show that SVM-ML has the best accuracy and efficiency among the three approaches. By comparing it with the existing empirical IBS models, we find that the developed SVM-ML method shows the same or better prediction accuracy on both datasets. Furthermore, based on the SVM model, the relationships between influencing variables and the IBS are analyzed through partial dependence plots. In addition, the stacking strategy of ML is adopted to further improve the prediction accuracy for IBS.

   abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

For this purpose, a database containing 642 data-records of field exposure data of Cs (along with the associated mixture proportion parameters, environmental conditions and exposure time) is established based on extensive literature surveying, which covers splash, tidal, and submerged zones in various areas in the world. The database is used to train five standalone ML models, that is, linear regression (LR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and random forests (RF) models, as well as an ensemble weighted voting-based ML model, and subsequently used to compare their prediction performances. It is shown that, by meta-heuristically combining predictions of RF, MLP-ANN, and SVM, the ensemble ML model produces higher accuracy of prediction compared to all standalone ML models tested in this study. The prediction performances of eight conventional quantitative models for Cs prediction are also analyzed based on the testing dataset selected for ML. The results show that adoption of more diverse datasets and consideration of more factors in conventional models can improve their prediction performance. The ensemble ML model established on a large database, can easily consider the twelve influencing factors (which is difficult for conventional models) in the database, and has superior prediction performance, yet better time-efficiency, compared to conventional models.},

The comparative studies reveal that, for this particular prediction problem, the trained models based on GBR and XGBoost perform better than those of SVR and MLP.},

   abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

   abstract = {The kriging-based genetic algorithm is applied to aerodynamic design problems. The kriging model is a response surface model that represents a relationship between objective function (output) and design variables (input) using a stochastic process. The kriging model drastically reduces the computational time required for objective function evaluation in the optimization (optimum searching) process. Expected improvement is used as a criterion to select additional sample points. This makes it possible not only to improve the accuracy of the response surface, but also to explore the global optimum efficiently. The functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted to evaluate the influence of each design variable and their interactions to the objective function. Based on the result of the functional ANOVA, designers can reduce the number of design variables by eliminating those that have small effect on the objective function. The present method is applied to a two-dimensional airfoil design and the prediction of flap's position in a multi-element airfoil, where the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is maximized.

Stochastic event-based methods consider all hazard scenarios that could adversely impact the infrastructure and their associated rates of occurrence. However, in many cases, such a comprehensive consideration of the spectrum of possible events requires high computational effort. This study presents an active learning method for selecting a subset of hazard scenarios for infrastructure risk assessment. Active learning enables the efficient training of a Gaussian process predictive model by choosing the data from which it learns. The method is illustrated with a case study of the Napa water distribution system where a risk-based assessment of the post-earthquake functional loss and recovery is performed. A subset of earthquake scenarios is sequentially selected using a variance reduction stopping criterion. The full probability distribution and annual exceedance curves of the network performance metrics are shown to be reasonably estimated.},

   abstract = {Many engineering applications are characterized by implicit response functions that are expensive to evaluate and sometimes nonlinear in their behavior, making reliability analysis difficult. This paper develops an efficient reliability analysis method that accurately characterizes the limit state throughout the random variable space. The method begins with a Gaussian process model built from a very small number of samples, and then adaptively chooses where to generate subsequent samples to ensure that the model is accurate in the vicinity of the limit state. The resulting Gaussian process model is then sampled using multimodal adaptive importance sampling to calculate the probability of exceeding (or failing to exceed) the response level of interest. By locating multiple points on or near the limit state, more complex and nonlinear limit states can be modeled, leading to more accurate probability integration. By concentrating the samples in the area where accuracy is important (i.e., in the vicinity of the limit state), only a small number of true function evaluations are required to build a quality surrogate model. The resulting method is both accurate for any arbitrarily shaped limit state and computationally efficient even for expensive response functions. This new method is applied to a collection of example problems including one that analyzes the reliability of a microelectromechanical system device that current available methods have difficulty solving either accurately or efficiently.

   abstract = {An important challenge in structural reliability is to keep to a minimum the number of calls to the numerical models. Engineering problems involve more and more complex computer codes and the evaluation of the probability of failure may require very time-consuming computations. Metamodels are used to reduce these computation times. To assess reliability, the most popular approach remains the numerous variants of response surfaces. Polynomial Chaos [1] and Support Vector Machine [2] are also possibilities and have gained considerations among researchers in the last decades. However, recently, Kriging, originated from geostatistics, have emerged in reliability analysis. Widespread in optimisation, Kriging has just started to appear in uncertainty propagation [3] and reliability [4,5] studies. It presents interesting characteristics such as exact interpolation and a local index of uncertainty on the prediction which can be used in active learning methods. The aim of this paper is to propose an iterative approach based on Monte Carlo Simulation and Kriging metamodel to assess the reliability of structures in a more efficient way. The method is called AK-MCS for Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation. It is shown to be very efficient as the probability of failure obtained with AK-MCS is very accurate and this, for only a small number of calls to the performance function. Several examples from literature are performed to illustrate the methodology and to prove its efficiency particularly for problems dealing with high non-linearity, non-differentiability, non-convex and non-connex domains of failure and high dimensionality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A constitutive relation that can describe tensile strain softening with or without simultaneous creep and shrinkage is presented, and an efficient timestep numerical integration algorithm, called the exponential algorithm, is developed. Microcracking that causes strain softening is permitted to take place only within three orthogonal planes. This allows the description of strain softening by independent algebraic relations for each of three orthogonal directions, including independent unloading and reloading behavior. The strain due to strain softening is considered as additive to the strain due to creep, shrinkage and elastic deformation. The time-step formulas for numerical integration of strain softening are obtained by an exact solution of a first-order linear differential equation for stress, whose coefficients are assumed to be spnstant duriijg the time step but may vary discontinuously between the steps.This algorithm is unconditionally stable and accurate even for very large time steps, and guarantees that the stress is always reduced exactly to zero as the normal tensile strain becomes very large. This algorithm, called exponential because its formulas involve exponential functions, may be combined with the well-known exponential algorithm for linear aging rate-type creep. The strain-softening model can satisfactorily represent the test data available in the literature. © ASCE.},

This study presents experiments and numerical modelling of the early-age stress evolution of Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) concrete, considering the development of autogenous deformation and creep. Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM) tests were conducted to obtain the autogenous deformation and stress evolution of restrained GGBFS concrete. By a self-defined material subroutine based on the Rate-type creep law, the FEM model for simulating the stress evolution in TSTM tests was established. By characterizing the creep compliance function with a 13-units continuous Kelvin chain, forward modelling was firstly conducted to predict the stress development. Then inverse modelling was conducted by Bayesian Optimization to efficiently modify the arbitrary assumption of the codes on the aging creep. The major findings of this study are as follows: 1) the high autogenous expansion of GGBFS induces compressive stress at first hours, but its value is low because of high relaxation and low elastic modulus; 2) The codes highly underestimated the early-age creep of GGBFS concrete. They performed well in prediction of stress after 200 h, but showed significant gaps in predictions of early-age stress evolution; 3) The proposed inverse modelling method with Bayesian Optimization can efficiently adjusted the aging terms which produced best modelling results. The adjusted creep compliance function of GGBFS showed a much faster aging speed at early ages than the one proposed by original codes.},

Experimental studies and numerical modelling become increasingly significant for understanding the microstructural properties during cement hydration. In this study, a multifunctional experiment combining ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements and dielectric conductivity measurements was performed both on cement paste and on concrete mixtures with water/cement ratio 0.4, 0.45, and 0.55 and with different amounts of aggregate. The samples were cured isothermally at 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. The measurements were conducted up to an age of 3 days for the cement paste and 7 days for concrete. The initial setting of cement paste was found at the time when a sudden increase in the ultrasonic pulse velocity occurred and a notable drop in the electric conductivity was observed. These sudden changes were also detected with the cement hydration simulation model HYMOSTRUC, in which a percolation threshold of the solid phase corresponded with the initial setting time. As expected, the lower water/cement ratio and the higher curing temperature exhibited a quick increase in ultrasonic pulse velocity and a remarkable decrease in conductivity. At a certain point of hydration, the pulse velocity showed a slow increase whereas at the same moment a full connectivity of solid phases was found with the simulation model. From this study, the validity of the HYMOSTRUC model was proved by comparison with the ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements and dielectric measurements. This multifunctional experimental setup also shows the potential for monitoring the evolution of cement hydration and the development of microstructure in hardening cement-based materials in a non-destructive way.},

However, this relationship is rarely addressed in constitutive models of material response to mechanical loads. Instead, the most frequently sought alternative for development of such models is by curve-fitting of the database of experimental stress-strain results for each range of nominal cylinder strength, this being related to the water-cement ratio. A simplified constitutive model that recognizes and incorporates the properties of microstructure and its influence on mechanical response is developed in this paper. The model evaluates uniaxial compressive stress at any level of axial strain, using a strain-dependent estimate of material stiffness. The initial elastic modulus of uncracked concrete is evaluated, based on water-cement ratio, age, volume fraction of aggregates, paste porosity, degree of hydration, and paste-aggregate interface properties. Reduction of the initial modulus with increasing load is modeled by the application of a factor that depends on the natural porosity of the material and mechanically induced porosity as it is assessed by the area strain that develops in the cross section supporting the load. Using this approach, it is possible to model the change effected on the initial resistance of the material from progressive microcrack growth and internal damage occurring in the concrete. The sensitivity of the proposed model to several variables was evaluated from parametric studies and by comparisons with available experimental data.},

Transgenic mouse embryos carrying the chicken Slug promoter-reporter gene showed a crest-specific activation of the reporter, suggesting the isolated sequence included the cis-regulatory elements to receive Slug-inducing signals in the mouse neural crest. While these potential cis-regulatory elements could be recognized and activated by corresponding transcription factors, such as Lef1 and Smad1, Wnt-Lef-beta-catenin signal failed to induce endogenous Slug expression in quail neural plate tissue prepared from forebrain and midbrain levels. In contrast, Slug expression and subsequent epithelial-mesenchymal transition were effectively induced by BMP4. Consistently, while we could detect phosphorylation of Smad1 in the ectoderm including the neural plate and the neural fold region, the activation of a reporter gene for a detection of canonical Wnt signal activation was below the level of detection at the forebrain and midbrain levels. These observations indicated that in the anterior ectoderm BMP signal has a predominant role for Slug expression.},

Although the sub- sequent introduction of the Dirichlet series expansion of the creep or relaxation function reduces these requirements by leading to a set of linear differential equa- tions equivalent to aging Kelvin or Maxwell chain models, problems arose in the identification of the aging moduli of these models. This paper refines and extends a recent formulation that remedies these problems by considering the aging to result from the progressive solidification of a basic constituent that behaves as a nonaging viscoelastic material. The new possibilities explored involve the alter- native use of the relaxation function for characterizing the nonaging constituent, and the expansion of both the compliance and relaxation functions of the constituent into Dirichlet series. In this way, one recovers the rate-type equations of an aging Kelvin or Maxwell chain in which all the moduli vary proportionally to a single aging function v(t). Some convenient advantages are the well-posedness of the problem of moduli identification, with always positive values, and the nonexistence of creep or relaxation reversal upon load removal.},

   abstract = {Packed bed chromatography is commonly applied for the separation of large molecules in biopharmaceutical industry. A technical chromatography system is typically composed of a cylindrical column that is filled with porous spheres. Particularly in small columns, which are increasingly applied for parallel experiments on lab robotic platforms, the impacts of inhomogeneous packing and wall effects on separation performance can be quite significant. We hence study mass transfer by convection, diffusion and adsorption in three-dimensional sphere packings. Random packings are externally generated and imported into COMSOL where the model equations are easy to implement. However, the COMSOL functions for automatic meshing and for iteratively solving the resulting equation systems fail to work with default settings. We have previously established a semi-automated and half-manual meshing procedure for rather small packings with less than 150 spheres that works with the direct PARDISO solver. The present contribution addresses the evaluation and optimization of the iterative equation solvers that are provided by COMSOL for the given spatial geometries with up to ten million degrees of freedom. The presented results illustrate that we can iteratively solve systems with up to 750 spheres using less memory and less computational time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {<p>Plain cement concrete, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) concrete, and fly ash concrete were designed. Three wet curing periods were employed, which were 2, 5, and 8 days. The drying shrinkage values of the concretes were measured within 1 year after wet curing. The results show that the increasing rate of the drying shrinkage of concrete containing a mineral admixture at late age is higher than that of plain cement concrete regardless of the wet curing time. With the reduction of wet curing time, the increment of total drying shrinkage of concrete decreases with the decrease of the W/B ratio. The negative effects on the drying shrinkage of fly ash concrete due to the reduction of the wet curing time are much more obvious than those of GGBS concrete and plain cement concrete. Superfine ground granulated blast furnace slag (SGGBS) can reduce the drying shrinkage of GGBS concrete and fly ash concrete when the wet curing time is insufficient.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Compressive strength is the most significant metric to evaluate the mechanical properties of concrete. Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown promising results for predicting compressive strength of concrete. However, at present, no in-depth studies have been devoted to the influence of dimensionality reduction on the performance of different ML models for this application. In this work, four representative ML models, i.e., Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are trained and used to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its mixture composition and curing age. For each ML model, three kinds of features are used as input: the eight original features, six Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-selected features, and six manually selected features. The performance as well as the training speed of those four ML models with three different kinds of features is assessed and compared. Based on the obtained results, it is possible to make a relatively accurate prediction of concrete compressive strength using SVR, XGBoost, and ANN with an R-square of over 0.9. When using different features, the highest R-square of the test set occurs in the XGBoost model with manually selected features as inputs (R-square = 0.9339). The prediction accuracy of the SVR model with manually selected features (R-square = 0.9080) or PCA-selected features (R-square = 0.9134) is better than the model with original features (R-square = 0.9003) without dramatic running time change, indicating that dimensionality reduction has a positive influence on SVR model. For XGBoost, the model with PCA-selected features shows poorer performance (R-square = 0.8787) than XGBoost model with original features or manually selected features. A possible reason for this is that the PCA-selected features are not as distinguishable as the manually selected features in this study. In addition, the running time of XGBoost model with PCA-selected features is longer than XGBoost model with original features or manually selected features. In other words, dimensionality reduction by PCA seems to have an adverse effect both on the performance and the running time of XGBoost model. Dimensionality reduction has an adverse effect on the performance of LR model and ANN model because the R-squares on test set of those two models with manually selected features or PCA-selected features are lower than models with original features. Although the running time of ANN is much longer than the other three ML models (less than 1s) in three scenarios, dimensionality reduction has an obviously positive influence on running time without losing much prediction accuracy for ANN model.</p>},

In the study, the six cement types, which contain up to 70% of main non-clinker constituents and four types of aggregate (basalt, granite, limestone and gravel) were used. The test results showed that cements with low clinker content allow to significantly reduce hardening temperature of concrete and thus, minimize the risk of cracks formation in concrete. Aggregate type has not affected concrete hardening temperature. However, it has an impact on magnitude of generated thermal stresses, caused by different thermal expansion coefficients of the aggregates. The most favourable aggregate types to use in mass concrete from the all analysed are granite, basalt and limestone. Usage of gravel aggregate in concrete, consisting mainly of quartz, might lead in certain unfavourable conditions to crack formation, caused by generated thermal stresses.},

   abstract = {During the process of setting and hardening in concrete, the temperature profile shows a gradual nonlinear distribution due to the development of heat of hydration in cement. At early ages of concrete structures, this nonlinear distribution can have a large influence on crack evolution. It is thus important to obtain an accurate temperature history, and to do this, it is necessary to examine the thermal properties of the concrete. In this study, the convective heat transfer coefficient, which represents the heat transfer between a concrete surface and ambient air, was experimentally investigated with test variables such as the velocity of wind, the curing conditions, and the ambient temperature. For analyses using the thermal equilibrium boundary condition, it is generally noted that most of the heat release by the evaporation of moisture occurs at an early stage. To consider this phenomenon, the existing thermal equilibrium boundary condition has been modified so as to consider the evaporation quantity due to the evaporation effect. Convective heat transfer coefficients for a specific case were then calculated from the modified thermal equilibrium boundary condition using experimental results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental research covered the determination of thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of early age concrete with different constituents. Experimental results have been used both to validate the numerical model and analysis of exemplary foundation slab. The results confirm the importance of the concrete mix composition and it has been shown that the early-age volume deformation and possible cracking is the result of the concerted action of thermal and mechanical properties of concrete. The obtained results indicate granite as the best aggregate for mass concrete.

   abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed-either explicitly or implicitly-to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an m × n matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require O(mn log(k)) floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to O(mnk) for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to O(k) passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data. © 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

While cement replacement with slag significantly reduced concrete temperature rise and delayed the time of cracking compared to the plain concrete, it was observed that stress development varied with the MgO/Al2O3 ratio of the slag. Increasing this ratio reduced the cracking temperature and delayed the time of cracking. The worst performance of the low MgO/Al2O3 ratio slag was attributed to its higher early-age reactivity, which was confirmed by isothermal calorimetry in addition to its higher autogenous shrinkage assessed by free shrinkage measurements.},

Although reliability analysis of such systems can be carried out by Monte Carlo simulations, the large number of structural analyses required results in prohibitively high computational costs. By using polynomial approximations of actual limit states in the reliability analysis, the number of analyses required can be minimized. Such approximations are referred to as Response Surfaces. This paper briefly describes the response surface methodology and critically evaluates existing approaches for choosing the experimental points at which the structural analyses must be performed. Methods are investigated to incorporate information on probability distributions of random variables in selecting the experimental points and to ensure that the response surface fits the actual limit state in the region of maximum likelihood. A criterion for reduction in the number of experiments after the first iteration is suggested. Two numerical examples show the application of the approach. © 1993.},

   abstract = {<p>Due to the low hydration rate of high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete at early age, the temperature gradient between the concrete core and surfaces could be effectively reduced. However, the low hydration rate results in a lack of hydration degree for early-age HVFA concrete. Thus, during curing, compared to the strength of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), a subsequent lower one of HVFA concrete leads to a more sensitive response to inner stresses induced by thermal and moisture loads. Based on ABAQUS, in this paper, user subroutines in the temperature and moisture fields were developed, with regard to the hydration degree, for simulation of the temperature and moisture influences on concrete. Additionally, the Double Power Law (DPL) model was used to depict early-age deformations of concrete in the mechanical field. Combined with the extended finite element method (XFEM), another subroutine for early-age cracking analysis in the mechanical field was then developed. Together with aforementioned subroutines, a thermo-hygro-mechanical model is derived. For evaluation of early-age cracking initiation and propagation of a pier composed of HVFA concrete, the model was implemented with XFEM. The obtained results show that (1) temperature and restraints are the main causes of cracking; (2) moisture loss affects surface cracks on structures at early age; and (3) although the temperature difference between the core and surfaces is not much obvious due to the reduced rate of heat dissipation from hydration, cracking of early-age HVFA concrete is still likely to happen for its low early strength. Thus, timely curing is critical to prevent early cracking.</p>},

A new model for the strength prediction was suggested based on the rate constant model. In this model, the equivalent ages introduced in the Saul and Arrhenius models were modified to show the effects of curing temperature at different ages. Test results show that the concrete subjected to a high temperature at an early age attains higher early-age strength but eventually attains lower later-age strength. The concrete subjected to a low temperature at an early age leads to lower early-age strength but al most the same later-age strength.

To date, the only available ZST prediction model for PCC pavements is the one proposed by the MEPDG, which was quite simplified with a function of only two input variables: cementitious content and mean monthly temperature for the month of construction. In this study, the feasibility of the current ZST prediction model in the MEPDG was assessed by comparing the ZSTs evaluated from a series of field tests with the ones estimated from the MEPDG model. In order to find ZSTs in actual PCC pavements, accurate evaluations of early-age concrete stress developments were essential. To achieve this aim, non-stress cylinders (NCs), which directly measure stress-independent strain in the field concrete structures, were employed. Once the stress-dependent strain history was estimated based on the measured total and stress-independent strain histories, it was converted to the stress history using a step-by-step numerical method considering creep and modulus developments of concrete. The results of this study showed that about 4.5-7.7 °C of differences existed between the measured and predicted ZST values. This finding strongly suggests a need for development of a more advanced ZST prediction model with reasonable assumptions and diverse parameters.},

   abstract = {High-performance concrete (HPC) generally experiences rather high autogenous shrinkage. If restrained, residual tensile stress will be induced which may be sufficient to cause cracking. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) has been utilized as a mineral admixture to reduce shrinkage cracking in HPC. The restrained shrinkage cracking of concrete containing GGBFS appears to be less than that of concrete without slag. However, the data is limited, and the effect of the GGBFS on the restrained cracking resistance needs to be further investigated. Restrained ring tests on cracking resistance of HPC using GGBFS as 0%, 20%, 35%, and 50% by weight replacements of cement were performed. Four concrete mixtures with the same w/b ratio of 0.32 were placed in a 23 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH environment, and covered with vinyl and aluminum adhesive tape. The outer rings were removed at 24 h after casting to allow water evaporation through the height of the specimen. Test results showed that: (1) the residual tensile stress at the age of 14.25 days after casting decreased by 18.6%, 33.2%, and 40.9% when the amount of GGBFS increased from 0% to 20%, 35%, and 50%, respectively; (2) the stress rate decreased by 58.9%, 62.5%, and 66.8% when the amount of GGBFS increased from 0% to 20%, 35%, and 50%, respectively, indicating that the cracking resistance based on stress rate increased with increasing GGBFS replacement.},

The method was applied to predict the macroscopic response of a non-uniformly degraded cement paste from leaching-induced decalcification by ammonium nitrate under 3-dimensional exposure conditions. Coupled nanoindentation with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy constitutive phase elemental analysis was used to link the mechanical response at each nanoindentation location to chemical composition and relate the mechanical phases identified statistically by Gaussian deconvolution to the chemical phases present in the microstructure. The nanoindentation phase characterization-based micro-macroscale upscaling method provided quantitative characterization of the relationship between microstructure evolution and mechanical properties as a function of chemical changes. The calculated homogenized elastic moduli of the reference and decalcified cement pastes ranged from 24.2–31.2 GPa and 9.2–11.7 GPa, respectively, and were of similar magnitude to the dynamic elastic moduli measured experimentally (31.1 ± 0.9 GPa and 13.7 ± 1.7 GPa, respectively). Furthermore, the degradation of the cement paste macroscale elastic modulus was controlled by the decalcification of the calcium-silicate-hydrate phases and the mechanical properties of the most prominent zone of the material.},

In this study, the mechanical properties and the fractions of individual phases are measured by nanoindentation and back scattered electron image analysis, respectively. The mechanical properties of the hardened paste at microscale are measured by microindentation. The effect of individual phases including the CSH, the residual clinker and the capillary pore on the effective modulus of the hardened cement paste is quantified. It is found that the effective modulus of pore needs to be set as 12 GPa rather than 0 GPa as the input for homogenization. As for the solid phases, the variation of the clinker modulus has limited influence on the homogenized modulus of the hardened cement paste. Whereas, the homogenized paste modulus increases significantly with the increasing fraction of high density CSH and the decreasing fraction of low density CSH.

In control SCC, cement was replaced with 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% of blast furnace slag. Two types of superplasticizers: polycarboxylate based superplasticizer and naphthalene sulphonate based superplasticizers were used. Tests were conducted for slump flow, the modified slump test, V-Funnel, J-Ring, U-Box, and compressive strength. The results showed that polycarboxylate based superplasticizer concrete mixes give more workability and higher compressive strength, at all ages, than those with naphthalene sulphonate based superplasticizer. Inclusion of blast furnace slag by substitution to cement was found to be very beneficial to fresh self-compacting concrete. An improvement of workability was observed up to 20% of slag content with an optimum content of 15%. Workability retention of about 45 min with 15% and 20% of slag content was obtained using a polycarboxylate based superplasticizer; compressive strength decreased with the increase in slag content, as occurs for vibrated concrete, although at later ages the differences were small. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The incorporation of MK causes an increase in strength, especially during the early ages of curing. However, the use of GGBS in concrete reduces the strength during the first 28 days. Beyond 28 days, the strength increases with the presence of GGBS up to 60% replacement.

   abstract = {The influence of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), namely silica fume, metakaolin, fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag, on the engineering properties of high strength concrete (HSC) has been investigated in this study. Workability, compressive strength, elastic modulus, porosity and pore size distribution were assessed in order to quantify the effects of the different materials. The results show that the inclusion of the different SCMs has considerable influence on the workability of HSC. Silica fume and metakaolin significantly enhanced the strength of HSC. Fly ash reduced the early-age strength; however, it enhanced the long-term strength of the HSC. Likewise, ground granulated blast-furnace slag impaired the early-age strength, but marginally improved the long-term strength at low replacement levels. The general effect of the different SCMs on the elastic modulus of HSC is rather small compared to their effect on strength. There are good correlations between both static and dynamic moduli and compressive strength. The EC 2 and ACI 209 provide a good estimate of static modulus of elasticity from compressive strength, while the BS8110 gives a good estimate of static modulus of elasticity from dynamic modulus of HSC containing the different SCMs. Porosity and pore size were reduced with the addition of the different SCMs. The volume of mesopores in the ranges of <15 nm and 15 - 30 nm was notably increased for HSC containing SCMs, whereas the percentage of macropores was significantly reduced. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Ground granulated blast furnace slag, which shows cementitious behavior (latent hydraulic activity) and pozzolanic characteristics (reaction with lime), has been widely used as a mineral admixture in normal and high strength concretes. Hydration of slag-blended cement is much more complex than that of ordinary Portland cement because of the mutual interactions between the cement hydration and the slag reaction. This paper presents a kinetic hydration model for cement-slag blends. The proposed model analyzes the slag reaction separate from cement hydration by considering the production of calcium hydroxide in cement hydration and its consumption in slag reactions. The amount of free water and the amount of calcium hydroxide left in the system were adopted as the control indicators for determining the slag reaction. Using the proposed model, the reaction ratio of slag can be evaluated as a function of curing age, considering the influences of the water to binder ratio, the slag replacement ratio and the curing temperature. Furthermore, the amount of chemically-bound water (self-cementing properties), calcium hydroxide (pozzolanic capabilities), and the heat released from hydration are evaluated by determining the contributions from both the cement hydration and the slag reaction. The evaluated results show good accordance with the experimental results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Under the project "EcoBéton" (Green concrete) funded by the French National Agency (ANR), concrete mixtures with a high quantity of mineral additions, such as blast-furnace slag and fly ash were studied. A first approach to quantify their cracking risk was to measure their plastic shrinkage evolution. In parallel, the evolution of other parameters such as setting, capillary depression and porosity were also monitored to relate this deformation to the evolution of the microstructure of the studied mixtures. Setting monitoring by means of ultrasonic measurements allows obtaining significant macroscopic information such as hardening process and rigidity evolution. The correlation between these different parameters shows that the plastic shrinkage evolution can be divided into three phases driven by different mechanisms. Moreover, it appears that the use of mineral additions has an effect on the plastic shrinkage behaviour, but this impact is not proportional to the percentage of additions. It depends on the hydration process and the microstructure of the cementitious materials. So, it seems that an optimum content of cement replacement by mineral additions must be sought to limit the development of plastic shrinkage of concretes with mineral additions at early age. However, a high rate of substitution of cement may affect the early age compressive strength of the concrete. So these mixtures were also optimised to obtain a significant compressive strength at an early age, but this optimisation leads to a higher risk of cracking for some of them. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Test results showed that BFS concrete exhibited greater autogenous shrinkage than ordinary concrete with no BFS with the same w / cm, and that the higher the BFS content, the greater the autogenous shrinkage. At the same content of BFS, the increasing rate of autogenous shrinkage is affected by the w / cm; the lower the w / cm, the smaller the increasing rate of autogenous shrinkage. Based on the test results, a prediction model for autogenous shrinkage was proposed. In particular, an effective autogenous shrinkage that is a realistic shrinkage strain responsible for stress development was introduced in the model. It was determined by taking into account the characteristics of ultrasonic pulse velocity evolution in concrete. This prediction method for autogenous shrinkage may be effectively used to estimate the stress induced by autogenous shrinkage. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, high dosages of silica fume (SF), typically adopted in UHPC, also lead to high autogenous shrinkage. This phenomenon, occurring at early ages, induces high internal stresses that, in turn, cause microcracking and increase permeability and, therefore, reduce the durability of concrete structures. The experimental study was conducted aiming to replace SF by another fine supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash (FA) or ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), in order to reduce the amount of autogenous shrinkage. The adopted approach involved partial or total replacement of SF by SCMs. Results indicate that the amount of fine pores in UHPC is a predominant factor that can highly affect the autogenous shrinkage. A strong correlation between the natural logarithm of autogenous shrinkage and the total porosity of UHPC mixtures was established. It was found that reducing the amount of fine pores in specimens containing FA or GGBS leads to a reduction of the autogenous shrinkage.},

   abstract = {The pore structure and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of concrete incorporating slag, silica fume and metakaolin were analyzed in this study. Some techniques such as mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), microhardness testing and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the effects of slag, silica fume and metakaolin on the pore structure, microhardness and morphology of the ITZ at 28 and 180 days. The traditional properties such as compressive strength were experimentally evaluated in relation to pore characteristics and ITZ. Meanwhile, the influence of silicon, as the major component of slag, silica fume and metakaolin, on thermodynamic stability of hydrate phases was further investigated. The experimental results show that mineral admixtures have positive impact on pore refinement and ITZ enhancement of concrete especially at later curing stages. The effect of the mineral admixtures on microstructure is in the sequence: metakaolin > silica fume > slag. The development of the compressive strength is related to the evolution of the pore structure and ITZ. Thermodynamic stability analysis indicates that if mineral admixtures are added to the CaO-Al2O 3-CaSO4-H2O system, the phase assemblage of C6AsH32 and C3AS0.8H4.4, which represents a member of the solid solution series Ca3Al 2(SiO4)3-x(OH)4x, has a lower Gibbs free energy of reaction and is therefore thermodynamically more stable than monosulfoaluminate at temperatures from 1 to 99 C. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Appropriate utilization of wasted coral aggregates on reefs or islands that are far from the mainland would substantially reduce construction costs and shorten the construction period of offshore projects, but the application of coral aggregate concrete (CAC) in island construction is limited due to the low strength and poor anti-permeability resistance of the coral aggregates. In this paper, eco-friendly slag-based alkali-activated materials (AAMs) were considered as alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) to improve the weak characteristics of the coral aggregates. The whole stress-strain curves, axial compressive strength (fc), elastic modulus (Ec), and Poisson's ratio (υc) of alkali-activated seawater coral aggregate concrete (AACAC) with different alkaline contents (Na2O-to-binder ratio of 3%, 4%, and 6% by mass) were investigated under uniaxial compression, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the interfacial microstructures between the paste matrix and the aggregates. The experimental results demonstrated that the failure patterns of CAC and AACAC under uniaxial compression were similar and were characterized by the coral aggregates being completely crushed. Additionally, the AACAC had a wider interfacial transition zone (ITZ), contained a higher Ec (approximately 9.9% improvement), and exhibited better ductility under the same concrete compressive strength (fcu) than the cement-based CAC. Finally, the constitutive relationship of stress-strain curves and an empirical model between Ec and fcu of AACAC were established based on the existing model.},

   abstract = {Shrinkage-induced cracking can impair the durability of concrete structures. In the past few decades, this topic has drawn more and more attention. Shrinkage of mortar and concrete is actually the result of the interaction between the shrinking cement paste and the non-shrinking aggregates. In recent years, different models that consider the restraining effect of aggregates, i.e. Series model and Hobbs’ model, have been proposed to predict the autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete. However, in these models both aggregate particles and cement paste matrix are considered as elastic materials. In fact, cement paste is not ideally elastic. Creep also plays an important role in autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete. In this paper an extended Pickett model, which takes the effect of creep into consideration, is proposed. The autogenous shrinkage of CEM I and CEM III/B cement mortar and concrete is simulated by using this model and compared with the experimental results to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. The results show that the extended Pickett model can well predict the autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete.},

   abstract = {In this paper, various mechanisms suggested to cause autogenous shrinkage are presented. The mechanisms are evaluated from the point of view of their soundness and applicability to quantitative modeling of autogenous shrinkage. The capillary tension approach is advantageous, because it has a sound mechanical and thermodynamical basis. Furthermore, this mechanism is easily applicable in a numerical model when dealing with a continuously changing microstructure. In order to test the numerical model, autogenous deformation and internal relative humidity (RH) of a Portland cement paste were measured during the first week of hardening. The isothermal heat evolution was also recorded to monitor the progress of hydration and the elastic modulus in compression was measured. RH change, degree of hydration and elastic modulus were used as input data for the calculation of autogenous deformation based on the capillary tension approach. Because a part of the RH drop in the cement paste is due to dissolved salts in the pore solution, a method is suggested to separate this effect from self-desiccation and to calculate the actual stress in the pore fluid associated with menisci formation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this paper, the underlying hydration model for determination of the heat release and its rate is refined for Ordinary Portland Cements (OPC) and extended towards blended cements. Hereby, the overall degree of hydration with one kinetic law is replaced by a multi-phase hydration model, taking the hydration kinetics of the main clinker phases into account. As regards blended cements, which are commonly used in engineering practice, the effect of slag hydration is incorporated into the presented multi-phase model. The developed hydration model for both plain and blended cement is validated by means of differential-calorimetry (DC) experiments. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results show that the cumulative distribution of Fuller-SS-S-C binder particles is close to Fuller distribution as a whole, but the particles of 0–15 μm, 15–30 μm, 30–45 μm and 45–80 μm fractions are SS-S-C (composite powder containing SS, S and cement), C (cement), SS-S (composite powder containing SS and S) and SS, respectively. The properties of Fuller-SS-S-C binder can be adjusted by changing compositions of SS-S-C in the range of 0–15 μm. Fuller-SS-S-C binders prepared have higher strength than reference blended cement, and their hydration heat contain three exothermic peaks and concentrate on after 15 hours. Compared with pure cement, the non-evaporable water content of Fuller-SS-S-C binder has great gap, but the pore size distribution of Fuller-SS-S-C binder is dominated by innocuous pores of less than 20 nm, moreover, the porosity, total pore volume and medium pore diameter of Fuller-SS-S-C binder are lower than those of reference blended cement and pure cement, indicating that Fuller-SS-S-C binder has dense microstructure.},

   abstract = {Monitoring the evolution of early age properties of concrete is necessary to provide input data to the models of prediction of the behavior of concrete structures since setting time. The experimental challenge lies in the fact that this monitoring must be fully automatic since the earliest age because the hardening process of the concrete takes place continuously over a period counted in hours and even in days after the casting time. This research paper presents a new methodology developed at ULB and IFSTTAR to monitor the creep and relaxation of an ordinary concrete chosen as reference concrete since setting time. Compressive creep rigs and two test devices were used: at ULB, a Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM) specifically designed for testing concrete since setting time under free and restraint conditions and at IFSTTAR, a test set up called BTJASPE developed to monitor, in compression, the modulus of elasticity, the creep and the relaxation of a concrete since very early age. For the sake of the study, the same concrete has been used in the two laboratories. In addition, this study is performed at a constant temperature to exclude this parameter, at this step of the study. The methodology is based on experimental measurements with two kinds of test. A classical creep test with permanent loading during one week and a repeated minute-long loading test for which every 30 min, a loading is applied and kept constant during 5 min and finally totally removed. The classical test is used to characterize the non-aging creep function and the repeated minute-long loading test is used to quantify the aging creep functions.},

An attempt is made to explain this phenomenon with fracture mechanic theories. No trend was identified for the influence of aggregate type on splitting and flexural tensile strength. The effectiveness of the SANS and EN elastic modulus prediction models was analysed against the test results and it was found that both prediction models accurately predicted elastic modulus values for the Andesite concrete, but produced far less accurate predictions for the Granite concrete.},

The results show that the ettringite could be selectively extracted by an ethylene glycol/methanol solvent with a volume ratio of 1:3, which thereby proved to be an effective method for the quantitative analysis of ettringite. Combined with the results of the X-ray diffraction analysis, the formation and transformation mechanisms of ettringite could be characterised and described in more detail. During the 90-d aging period, the reaction degree of the coal gangue was higher than that of fly ash and had a greater impact on the formation and transformation of ettringite.

However OH- may be replaced by SO42- and CO32-. Except for limited replacement (50 mol%, maximum) of sulfate by hydroxide, these compositions do not form solid solutions and, from the mineralogical standpoint, behave as separate phases. Therefore many hydrated cements will contain mixtures of AFm phases. AFm phases have been made from precursors and experimentally-determined phase relationships are depicted at 25 °C. Solubility data are reported and thermodynamic data are derived. The 25 °C stability of AFm phases is much affected by the nature of the anion: carbonate stabilises AFm and displaces OH and SO4 at species activities commonly encountered in cement systems. However in the presence of portlandite, and as carbonate displaces sulfate in AFm, the reaction results in changes in the amount of both portlandite and ettringite: specimen calculations are presented to quantify these changes. The scheme of phase balances enables calculation of the mineralogical balances of a hydrated cement paste with greater accuracy than hitherto practicable. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is suggested that ettringite forms by a through-solution mechanism and that expansive force results from crystallization pressure as well as swelling pressure converted from the reduction of chemical potentials in the reaction of ettringite formation. Expansion depends mainly on the positions where ettringite crystals form. In a pore solution of high alkalinity, ettringite crystals form in situ and cause a large expansion. Alternately, they precipitate partially or completely in voids, thus giving rise to a little expansion or no expansion. © 1993.},

En las últimas décadas, los académicos, los responsables políticos y los gestores de riesgos han ido reconociendo que las iniciativas comunitarias pueden representar una alternativa prometedora para hacer frente al peligro de las inundaciones a escala local. En el contexto del Marco de Sendai para la Reducción del Riesgo de Desastres 2015- 2030 (SFDRR), este artículo presenta una revisión bibliográfica sistemática del cuerpo de literatura global reciente sobre el tema. El artículo analiza 40 artículos publicados en los últimos cinco años para identificar los tipos de compromiso permitidos en los proyectos y discutir los debates emergentes en el campo desde el establecimiento del SFDRR. La revisión de la literatura interroga dónde se están desarrollando estos enfoques y cómo los enfoques basados en la comunidad han estado apoyando el logro de los objetivos del SFDRR. La revisión muestra que un creciente cuerpo de literatura ha estado aplicando la reducción del riesgo de desastres basada en la comunidad (CBDRR) y los métodos de ciencia ciudadana para responder a la llamada de un enfoque más centrado en las personas hacia las inundaciones. Este llamamiento, esbozado por el SFDRR, es especialmente pertinente en el contexto de las comunidades vulnerables, como los residentes de los asentamientos informales, que históricamente se han visto afectados de forma desproporcionada por las inundaciones. El artículo aporta una contribución original a este campo al documentar y reflexionar sobre los resultados de primera mano de un programa comunitario a largo plazo de evaluación de los riesgos de inundación llevado a cabo dentro del programa de Revitalización de los Asentamientos Informales y sus Entornos (RISE). El artículo expone la ejecución funcionamiento y conclusiones iniciales del proyecto, en el que participaron miembros de la comunidad en la documentación de los niveles de inundación en asentamientos informales en Suva (Fiyi) y Makassar (Indonesia) entre 2018 y 2020. Los resultados del estudio de caso sugieren que los enfoques que involucran a las comunidades en el monitoreo de las inundaciones pueden, además de facilitar la documentación de las inundaciones, desbloquear beneficios adicionales de reducción de riesgos, como la mejora del capital social y la facilitación de la comunicación de riesgos. Las conclusiones destacan que, de forma similar al proyecto de seguimiento de inundaciones de RISE, se han desarrollado otras iniciativas de base comunitaria en todo el mundo. Aunque estas iniciativas varían significativamente en cuanto al grado de participación de la comunidad y sus métodos, la mayor parte de la bibliografía coincide en que estos métodos emergentes se consideran especialmente prometedores en cuanto a la mejora del conocimiento y la concienciación sobre las catástrofes cuando los miembros de la comunidad participan en la reducción del riesgo de catástrofes. Sin embargo, la revisión de este cuerpo de literatura indica que se necesita más investigación para examinar cómo el capital social, así como los aspectos culturales y políticos, pueden ser aprovechados y reforzados para desempeñar papeles importantes en la respuesta a las inundaciones.},

The mean aluminosilicate chain length of the C-S-H was very long in all the samples and would be expected to have increased with age. The TEM-EDX and NMR data are consistent with nanostructural models for C-S-H.

   abstract = {Early age cracking in hardening concrete can be evaluated using dedicated calculation methods. Such calculations require a wide selection of input parameters, e.g. autogenous- and thermal deformation, hydration heat evolvement, tensile strength, E-modulus, creep, cross-section dimensions, structural configuration (degree of restraint) and climatic conditions. However, several factors can affect these materials properties and input parameters, and hence the cracking tendency of the concrete. Over the recent years, early age cracking has been included in several research projects at NTNU. In this regard, various laboratory test programs on early age cracking have been performed, providing a comprehensive matrix of results and a unique opportunity for parameter studies on e.g., fly ash content, SRA-addition, aggregate type, cement batch, w/c-ratio, degree of restraint and climatic conditions. The laboratory tests comprise both mechanical testing and restrained stress tests in the Temperature-Stress Testing Machine (TSTM). The present compilation showed that in addition to the obvious effects of degree of restraint and climatic conditions, also several of the other investigated parameters had a considerable influence on the cracking tendency of the given concrete, e.g., cement-by-fly ash replacement caused a clear reduction of the cracking risk, while variations between different batches of the same type of cement highly influenced the strength, the heat evolvement, the AD development, and consequently also the cracking risk of the given concrete.},

To predict the risks of early age shrinkage cracking of environmentally friendly CEM III-based UHPC, a numerical model originally developed for early age crack assessment of ordinary concrete, has been further developed and applied on a demonstration wall with high risk of cracking, cast on a non-deforming slab. The design of the wall was determined through numerical simulation using different parameters, resulting from specific experiments performed on the desired concrete mixture. Early age crack assessment parameters for the model were obtained through different tests performed using the Temperature-Stress Testing Machine (TSTM). Finally, this UHPC wall was built, and occurring strain deformations were recorded in real time using fiber optic (SOFO) sensors embedded in the wall, and measurements taken from demountable mechanical strain gauges (DEMEC). Restrained shrinkage measurements were obtained for the same mixture through ring tests. A comparison between the numerical simulation results and the measurements proved that the proposed model is suitable for UHPC, and the model predicts well the time of crack appearance. Finally, it has been shown that shrinkage values along the wall height are influenced by the degree of restraint.},

In design practice, the long-term delayed strain of concrete is decomposed into four components: autogenous shrinkage, basic creep, drying shrinkage and drying creep. The four components are first computed separately and then summed up to obtain the total delayed strain of concrete, without wondering about any potential correlation between them. In this work, we aim at modeling the total delayed strain in a unified manner, without assuming this decomposition a priori. Such model is derived in the framework of viscoelastic poromechanics. The influence of relative humidity on the creep properties is taken into account. We assume that drying creep is due to the fact that the mechanical consequences of capillary effects are larger in loaded drying specimens than in non-loaded drying specimens. The model is validated by comparing the prediction with experimental results of delayed strain from the literature and discussed with respect to existing models.},

Cement pastes and UHPC with water-to-cement ratio below 0.25, with or without SAP, were studied. The absorption capacity of a solution-polymerized SAP was first determined on hardened cement pastes by SEM image analysis. It was observed that the SAP cavities become partially filled with portlandite during cement hydration. Isothermal calorimetry showed that water entrainment with SAP delays the main hydration peak, while after a couple of days it increases the degree of hydration in a manner similar to increasing the water-to-cement ratio. Internal curing by SAP is effective in reducing the internal relative humidity decrease and the autogenous shrinkage. Although the mechanical properties are affected by SAP addition, it is possible to reach compressive strengths of almost 150 MPa at 28 days.},

This study reports an experimental investigation on the “time-zero” of AAFS pastes characterized by different techniques. It is found that the internal capillary pressure in AAFS pastes significantly increased after 5–7.5 h, which is far beyond the final setting time that is normally regarded as “time-zero” for Portland cement. The transition time derived from capillary pressure method directly captures the alteration of capillary stress in AAFS, which matches well with the change of the shrinkage slope. Due to the moisture equilibrium between the specimens and humidity sensor, it is hard to use the measured internal relative humidity to determine the real “time-zero” of AAFS. This research finds that the onset of capillary pressure in AAFS paste provides a more scientific and accurate determination of “time-zero”.},

There is a general agreement about the existence of a relationship between autogenous shrinkage and RH changes in hardening cement paste. An improved hygrometer method was developed for monitoring the change of internal RH in cement pastes 1 h after casting. This provides immediate experimental results of RH change for determining the “time-zero”. It indicates that the internal RH of cement pastes does not decrease immediately after the final setting time.

Nevertheless, the content of C-S-H interlayer water remained similar and no change in C-S-H pore sizes were observed when increasing the sulfate content. The data allowed to calculate the volume composition of hydrated cement pastes at 3 days of hydration.

Three substitution rates of cement by slag were used (30%, 50% and 70%). The tests were performed at two constant temperatures (20 °C and 40 °C) in order to assess the activation energy of the different components. A multiphasic hydratation model is proposed to take account of the difference of kinetics of each main phase (clinker and slag) and the hydration kinetic law proposed considers interactions between the two phases. It includes the activation of the dissolution of slag by alkalis released by the clinker phases in the pore solution, the portlandite consumption by slag and the effect of temperature and moisture content on the reaction kinetics. The model is able to simulate the evolution of hydration products and adjust the hydration product stoechimetry to the rates of slag and the current temperature automatically and instantaneously. Its reliability is shown through its ability to fit the whole experimental plan results with a single parameter set. Among these parameters are the hydration heat of slag and its water consumption. The model and its parameters should be useful to simulate other types of slag-blended cement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The effect of capillary water on the creep of cement paste is studied by carrying out microindentation tests on samples with and without drying. The results of the microindentation studies have been analysed by plotting the discrete retardation spectra (DRS). DRS for SC and DC specimens distinctly show the presence of two short-term creep mechanisms, one occurring around 0.6–1.0 s, and another occurring around 10 s, and a long-term creep mechanism occurring much beyond 10 s. The results indicate that presence of capillary water seems to have a significant influence on creep compliance of cement paste loaded at early ages.},

This work applies microindentation techniques, which allow quickly assessing the long term rate, to investigate the effect of relative humidities on both the viscous behaviour of a cement paste. A large campaign of microindentation tests was carried out at different relative humidities, loading histories, curing times, and load levels for both creep and relaxation testing. The correlations between creep rate, relaxation rate, and relative humidity were investigated. The results showed that the increase of the relative humidity reduces the indentation modulus and hardness, but increases the long term creep rate of a cement paste. The effect of the relative humidity on the creep rate was possibly explained by local forces acting on Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates sheets or by microcracking drying effects.},

In this work, the temperature-dependent elastic modulus of UHPC is estimated through the step-by-step homogenization from gel matrix level to ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete level. Totally three forms of C-S-H gels are considered to determine the elastic properties of the initial matrix, and the phase transformation and volume fractions of individual phases at high temperatures are calculated based on the hydration and dehydration kinetics models. Moreover, the effects of imperfect interface and inclusion size are taken into account by introducing the spring-layer interface model and log-normal size distribution function to the homogenization scheme. The predicted elastic moduli are validated by analytical and experimental results, showing that accurate predictions can be obtained at up to 800°C. Interestingly, the imperfect interface matters when high-modulus inclusions are embedded in the low-modulus matrix, and the effect of imperfect interface on effective elastic modulus varies a lot at different microscopic levels. The findings highlight the synergistic effects of imperfect interface and inclusion size on the elastic properties, which is helpful to the mechanical design of UHPC at high temperatures.},

In this study, the effective elastic properties of cement pastes with water/cement (w/c) ratios of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were homogenized from the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) scale based on a multiscale model. The perfect and imperfect interfaces between inclusions and the matrix were assumed for the prediction. The imperfect interface is characterized by spring-layers of vanishing thickness in the tangential directions, and an interface sliding parameter (π/d) is used to reflect the imperfection of the interfaces. The predicted results were then compared to the measured one by instrumented indentation as well as the existing data from the literature. It is found that the perfect interface condition would overestimate the elastic modulus of cement-based materials. However, the homogenization scheme with imperfect interface can predict the effective elastic properties very well. This indicates that the imperfect interface may exist in cement-based materials and affect the effective elastic properties. The imperfect interface effect appears to be less significant with increasing curing age and vary with the mix proportion of cement-based materials. Therefore, the imperfect interface conditions should be adopted in the homogenization of the elastic properties for cement-based materials.},

Most notably, chloride ions from sea water or de-icing salts are potentially harmful since they promote corrosion of steel reinforcement. Concrete cover of sufficient quality and depth can ensure protection of the steel reinforcement. However, it is necessary to study the effects of material heterogeneity and cracking on chloride ingress in concrete. This is done herein by proposing a three-dimensional lattice model capable of simulating chloride transport in saturated sound and cracked concrete. Means of computationally determining transport properties of individual phases in heterogeneous concrete (aggregate, mortar, and interface), knowing the concrete composition and its averaged transport properties, are presented and discussed. Based on numerical experimentation and available literature, a relation between the effective diffusion coefficient of cracked lattice elements and the crack width was adopted. The proposed model is coupled with a lattice fracture model to enable simulation of chloride ingress in cracked concrete. The model was validated on data from the literature, showing good agreement with experimental results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Their strong heterogeneity and multiscale microstructure make the study of the mechanical properties and the in-service behaviour very challenging: new techniques are required by industrial research to better investigate these aspects. In this work a novel technique based on statistical nanoindentation is exploited to obtain results about the microstructure build-up and the mechanical properties. An innovative high-speed nanoindentation method is here combined and compared with a standard nanoindentation procedure in order to get highly consistent statistical results. Combining the high-speed nanoindentation, the statistical deconvolution and SEM/EDS investigations, the main phases present in the tested hydrated cement paste have been characterized. High-resolution maps of the mechanical properties are in good agreement with SEM-EDS results. The evolution of the mechanical properties has been tested over the time and in particular after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days of hydration. It was found that the nano-mechanical properties were almost constant during the hydration time and the evolution of the bulk mechanical resistance properties of the cement paste is found to be due to a variation of the volume proportions between the three principal phases (low-density, high-density and ultra-high-density C-S-H).},

   abstract = {Cementitious materials are modified by the addition of polymers in order to improve the durability and the adhesive strength. However, polymer-modified mortars and concretes exhibit lower elastic moduli in comparison to unmodified systems. The macroscopic properties are governed by microstructural changes in the binder matrix, which consists of both cementitious and polymer components. Herein, different polymer-modified cement pastes were characterized using nanoindentation to better understand the microscopic origin of the macroscopic elastic modulus. By means of the statistical nanoindentation technique, the existence of three micromechanical phases in plain and polymer-modified cement pastes with a water-to-cement mass ratio of 0.40 is evidenced, illustrating that the polymer modification does not induce the formation of additional reaction products. Instead, the polymers adsorb on the hydration products as well as on unhydrated clinker grains and decrease the indentation moduli of the micromechanical phases. The link between the microscopic and macroscopic mechanical properties is established by means of a continuum micromechanics approach. A multiscale model aimed at the prediction of the elastic moduli of polymer-modified cementitious materials is developed with input parameters that are partially obtained from the nanoindentation tests. The comparison of the modeling results with the experimentally determined elastic (macroscopic) moduli at the scales of cement paste, mortar, and concrete is satisfactorily good, underlining the predictive capability of the modeling approach. The improvement of prediction models is essential for the application of polymer-modified cementitious materials in construction and will encourage their integration into design guidelines.},

A series of indentation tests, microscopic tests and theoretical studies were carried out to obtain the creep properties of individual phases of hardened paste and contact creep modulus and thickness of the ITZ around coarse aggregate. Results indicated that the addition of silica fume significantly improved the quantity and quality of gel in the matrix. Meanwhile the performance of ITZ was enhanced while its thickness was decreased by 29%. The above effects contribute to the improved ability of concrete to resist creep. To quantitatively evaluate the creep properties, the concrete materials were divided into four different scales from nanoscale to macroscale. A homogenization method combining Mori-Tanaka (MT) scheme and self-consistent (SC) scheme was used to calculate the contact creep modulus of concrete. Besides, two ITZ simulation models of bond-slip and homogeneous solid were discussed on the fourth scale to verify the accuracy of the model and confirm the significances of ITZ properties and thickness in creep analysis.},

For this purpose, greyscale level based digital microstructure was generated by X-ray microcomputed tomography with a resolution of 2 μm/voxel length. In addition, statistics based micromechanical properties (i.e. Young's modulus and hardness) were derived from the grid nanoindentation test which was set to have an interaction volume the same as the resolution of the digital microstructure. A linear relationship between the two probability density functions of greyscale level and local Young's modulus was assumed and verified by the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K–S) statistic. Based on this assumption, the fracture and deformation of a digital cubic volume with a dimension of 100 μm under uniaxial tension was simulated using a lattice fracture model. In addition, the influence of heterogeneity on fracture response was studied. Furthermore, the proposed method was compared with the results obtained from a traditional approach used previously by the authors in which discrete phases (capillary pore, anhydrous cement clinker, outer and inner hydration products) were considered. The two methods show similar crack patterns and stress-strain responses. The proposed method is regarded more promising as it captures also the gradient of material properties (within the discrete phases) in the cement paste.},

The test results were used to fit existing analytical size effect models. Although a good fit can be found for the existing size effect models, special attention should be given to the physical meaning behind these empirical parameters. In addition, a multi-scale modelling strategy that considers microstructural features at different length scales was adopted to model the trend of decreasing strength with specimen size observed in experiments. A good agreement between experimental observations and modelling results indicates that the featured material structure dominates the observed size effect on measured strength in the size range considered.},

   abstract = {In this study, a numerical model using a 2D lattice network is developed to investigate the fatigue behaviour of cement paste at the microscale. Images of 2D microstructures of cement pastes obtained from XCT tests are used as inputs and mapped to the lattice model. Different local mechanical and fatigue properties are assigned to different phases of the cement paste. A cyclic constitutive law is proposed for considering the fatigue damage evolution. Fatigue experiments performed at the same length scale are used to calibrate and validate the model. The proposed model can reproduce well the flexural fatigue experimental results, in terms of S-N curve, stiffness degradation and residual deformation. The validated model is then used to predict the uniaxial tensile fatigue fracture of cement paste. The effects of microstructure and stress level on the fatigue fracture are studied using the proposed model. This model forms a basis for the multiscale analysis of concrete fatigue.},

   abstract = {This paper addresses some lattice model techniques used in numerical simulations of fracture in concrete and other random materials. The influence of lattice element type and lattice orientation on the fracture pattern was investigated by simulating a shear loading experiment on a concrete plate. Beam elements with three degrees of freedom per node, and with a random orientation of the beams within the lattice, gave the best comparison with experiment. The effect of element resolution on fracture results was also investigated. A new fracture law has been developed that uses principal tensile stresses in each node of the lattice to determine which beam should break at every step of a simulation. For the implementation of heterogeneity in the model, a method has been developed that uses digital images of the real microstructure of a material. Simulated crack patterns were obtained for a real material, using this technique, which appear quite realistic. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {It has long been recognized, in cement chemistry, that two types of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) exist in cement-based materials, but less is known about how the two types of C-S-H affect the mechanical properties. By means of nanoindentation tests on nondegraded and calcium leached cement paste, the paper confirms the existence of two types of C-S-H, and investigates the distinct role played by the two phases on the elastic properties of cement-based materials. It is found that (1) high-density C-S-H are mechanically less affected by calcium leaching than low density C-S-H, and (2) the volume fractions occupied by the two phases in the C-S-H matrix are not affected by calcium leaching. The nanoindentation results also provide quantitative evidence, suggesting that the elastic properties of the C-S-H phase are intrinsic material properties that do not depend on mix proportions of cement-based materials. The material properties and volume fractions are used in a novel two-step homogenization model, that predicts the macroscopic elastic properties of cement pastes with high accuracy. Combined with advanced physical chemistry models that allow, for a given w/c ratio, determination of the volume fractions of the two types of C-S-H, the model can be applied to any cement paste, with or without Portlandite, Clinker, and so on. In particular, from an application of the model to decalcified cement pastes, it is shown that that the decalcification of the C-S-H phase is the primary source of the macroscopic elastic modulus degradation, that dominates over the effect of the dissolution of Portlandite in cement-based material systems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of oxidation on mechanical properties for all these stress states was estimated. The link between the mechanical properties and the changes induced by oxidation of the material density was established. Overall, oxidation leads to a reduction of the initial moduli. This work shows also that X-ray tomography is a good tool for measuring, by a non-destructive method, the material density over a given volume. Potentially, the results obtained by destructive mechanical tests on laboratory specimens and by non-destructive X-ray tomography techniques on large scale parts can be put together in order to estimate, in a non-destructive way, the mechanical properties in some locations of that part. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Image classification and bounding box approaches have been proposed in existing vision-based automated concrete crack detection methods using deep convolutional neural networks.

Performance of three different pre-trained network architectures, which serves as the FCN encoder's backbone, is evaluated for image classification on a public concrete crack dataset of 40,000 227 × 227 pixel images. Subsequently, the whole encoder-decoder FCN network with the VGG16-based encoder is trained end-to-end on a subset of 500 annotated 227 × 227-pixel crack-labeled images for semantic segmentation. The FCN network achieves about 90% in average precision. Images extracted from a video of a cyclic loading test on a concrete specimen are used to validate the proposed method for concrete crack detection. It was found that cracks are reasonably detected and crack density is also accurately evaluated.},

Accordingly, the present study proposes a nearly automated inspection model based on image processing and deep learning for detecting defects in typically inaccessible areas of concrete structures. Results indicate that using the Keras classifier combined with Otsu image processing can achieve superior classification accuracy of 97.63%, 96.5%, and 96.17% for training, validation, and testing data, respectively, along with low quantification error of 1.5%, 5% and 2% for the crack length, width, and angle of orientation, respectively. The type of structural damage and its severity are identified based on the allowed range of concrete crack width for different structures, including buildings and bridges based on different international standards and codes. The proposed method can deploy unmanned aerial vehicle image acquisition to offer a nearly automated inspection platform for the colossal backlog of aging concrete structures.},

In this study, an improved deep fully convolutional neural network, named as CrackSegNet, is proposed to conduct dense pixel-wise crack segmentation. The proposed network consists of a backbone network, dilated convolution, spatial pyramid pooling, and skip connection modules. These modules can be used for efficient multiscale feature extraction, aggregation, and resolution reconstruction which greatly enhance the overall crack segmentation ability of the network.

The high-fidelity dataset generated by a computational homogenization approach is used for training the 3D-CNN models. The inference results of the trained networks on unseen data indicate that the network is capable of capturing the microstructural features of RVEs and produces an accurate prediction of effective stiffness and Poisson's ratio. The benefits of the 3D-CNN over conventional finite-element-based homogenization with regard to computational efficiency, uncertainty quantification and model's transferability are discussed in sequence. We find the salient features of the 3D-CNN approach make it a potentially suitable alternative for facilitating material design with fast product design iteration and efficient uncertainty quantification.},

However, generating stress-strain curves from numerical methods such as finite element method (FEM) is computationally intensive, especially when considering the entire failure path for a material. As a result, it is difficult to perform high throughput computational design of materials with large design spaces, especially when considering mechanical responses beyond the elastic limit. In this work, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to predict the entire stress-strain behavior of binary composites evaluated over the entire failure path, motivated by the significantly faster inference speed of empirical models. We show that PCA transforms the stress-strain curves into an effective latent space by visualizing the eigenbasis of PCA. Despite having a dataset of only 10-27% of possible microstructure configurations, the mean absolute error of the prediction is <10% of the range of values in the dataset, when measuring model performance based on derived material descriptors, such as modulus, strength, and toughness.

Supercritical drying is proposed as a method that could effectively preserve the cement microstructure, but which has not been applied to cementitious materials. Experiments are reported that systematically quantify the effects of drying from several solvents, freeze drying, and direct drying of young paste. Freeze drying is an effective drying method to prepare samples for chemical analysis, but it might change the microstructure.

However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer $h_\{n - 1\}$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters $\theta$ to get the raw scores $o_\{i\}$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores $o_\{i\}$ by $0$, i.e. $f(o) = \max(0, o_\{i\})$, where $f(o)$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions $\hat\{y\}$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax $f(x)$.},

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

The volume fractions of mechanically different phases obtained from statistical NI (SNI) analysis are shown to be different from those obtained by back-scattered electron (BSE) image analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) method on the same paste. Judging from transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, the representative volume element of low-density calcium-silicate hydrates (C-S-H) can be considered to be around 500 nm, whereas for high-density C-S-H it is about 100 nm. This raises the question how the appropriate penetration depth for NI experiments should be selected. Changing the maximum load from 1 mN to 5 mN, the effect of penetration depth on the experimental results is studied. As an alternative to the SNI method, a "manual" indentation method is proposed, which combines information from BSE and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), coupled to the NI machine. The AFM allows to precisely indent a high-density C-S-H rim around unhydrated clinkers in cement paste. Yet the results from that technique still show a big scatter. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

XPM is tested on three typical cementitious samples: cement paste, fly-ash and slag blended cement pastes. The results from the techniques were found quantitatively comparable in terms of local mechanical properties. The methods are characterized by different spatial resolution, different property fluctuations and acquisition times. High-speed loading in XPM brings strain rate effects that are not present in standard modes. The paper summarizes advantages and disadvantages of each technique and shows mutual comparisons for the tested composites. It is concluded that the new XPM mode brings an advantage of very fast characterization of heterogeneous composites with reasonably high spatial resolution. The quantitativeness of the method is disturbed by strain rate effects causing artificial shift of the properties towards higher values compared to static loading cases. Some parameters associated with longer acquisition times such as creep properties are not captured with XPM. XPM is especially suited for fast sensing of local differences between composite phases on smaller areas (≈103μm2). Statistical data from larger sample areas (104-105μm2) are still easier obtainable from classical grid nanoindentation.},

In order to properly model the micromechanical properties of HCP, advanced mechanical models, well-characterised microstructures and proper input parameters are required. However, due to the complex material structure of HCP, this is not an easy to achieve for any of the three aforementioned aspects. Therefore, this paper aims at reviewing of the techniques that have been developed to contribute to the micromechanical modelling.

   abstract = {Recent results of statistical nanoindentation testing on hardened cement pastes (HCP) reported in the literature show a multipeak response in the elastic modulus frequency plots. These peaks have been interpreted as indicating the true elastic modulus of two calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) phases of different densities. However, the application of statistical indentation for determining material properties of single phases in HCP appears to violate some of the basic principles of the technique. To elucidate this aspect, virtual experiments emulating statistical nanoindentation are performed and presented in this paper. They are based on 3D images of: (i) an idealized two-phase material and (ii) HCP acquired by focussed ion beam nanotomography (FIB-nt); within both 3D images, a marching object is sampled over a large number of positions. Based on the local phase composition within the marching object, a local stiffness is estimated by using simple composite models. Due to the large number of the investigated positions, the elastic modulus can be statistically evaluated in the same manner as in the real statistical indentation experiments. The results presented in this paper indicate that the homogenous C-S-H regions present in HCP are too small to cause independent and separated peaks in the elastic modulus plots. Moreover, the presence of phases other than C-S-H, namely unhydrated cement and calcium hydroxide, may also produce spurious peaks in the frequency plots. In conclusion, the presented results question the notion that the multipeak signature in statistical nanoindentation experiments on HCP can be explained only by the presence of two distinct C-S-H phases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there have been inconsistencies in the measured elastic moduli and debate on the creep mechanism of calcium (alumino) silicate hydrates (C-(A-)S-H). To bring new insights, we examined the deviatoric stress-induced preferred orientation of calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C-A-S-H), portlandite, and ettringite compacts, using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. Intense preferred orientations were observed in C-A-S-H compacts, and the c-axis of unit cells is highly aligned with the compression direction; weaker c-axis related fiber-type texture formed in portlandite and ettringite. Higher humidity, greater compacting pressure, and/or increased duration of the pressure intensified the C-A-S-H preferred orientation, which is facilitated by gel-pore water lubrication. This pressure-induced time-dependent preferential re-orientation of crystallites can contribute to the creep of cement-based materials, and it may cause overrepresentation of the soft c-axis of C-(A-)S-H unit-cell in nanoindentation experiments and underestimation of Young's modulus.},

A comparison is made between simulated 2D fracture response from individual slices and simulated fracture response of 3D structure, which is reconstructed from the 2D slices. In addition, the influence of heterogeneity on fracture response was studied. 3D microstructure enables more stable crack propagation, branching and crack trapping, which is attributed to more restrain and phase connectivity.

We analyze all experimental data available in the literature and find that autogenous shrinkage evolves logarithmically with respect to time at long term, like basic creep. Then, by considering concrete as a multiscale material, we obtain the bulk creep modulus of the calcium silicate hydrate gel. In the end, we show that the kinetics of long-term autogenous shrinkage can be a viscoelastic response to self-desiccation by comparing the mechanical stress that should be applied to explain this long-term kinetics of autogenous shrinkage with the capillary force due to self-desiccation.},

   abstract = {Autogenous shrinkage of cement paste depends on the competition between bulk stress (driving force) and deformation restriction (intrinsic modulus). Since the bulk stress can be calculated according to capillary theory, the deformation restriction contributed by unhydrated phase should be paid more attention due to its higher proportion and modulus. However, it is hard to trace the development of unhydrated particles distribution and time-dependent modulus in real time. To clarify the deformation restriction of unhydrated phase, cement pastes consist of nearly fully-hydrated matrix and inert fillers with targeted size and volume were prepared in the present study. Based on the bulk stress calculated by saturation degree and the modulus obtained by upscaling calculation, an empirical function was proposed to link autogenous shrinkage, internal stress, and deformation restriction of cement paste directly. Moreover, the deformation restriction mechanism of unhydrated particles was explained by the effective volume of restricted region around the unhydrated particle, and the deformation restriction can be maximized by rationally arranging unhydrated phase with volume content of 30–40% and particle size of 5–10 μm. The results provide a new sight in understanding the deformation restriction of unhydrated phase, and then lay a solid foundation to minimize the shrinkage of cement-based materials by microstructurally design of cement paste.},

The results show that both blended systems had higher creep than pure cement paste at early ages and that the creep compliance of the blended system with fly ash was higher than with quartz. While this difference is in part due to the restraining effect of the elastic phases, the amount of C–S–H and the porosity, dissolution creep may also play a role.

   abstract = {This paper presents the effect of nano-CaCO3 (NC) on the compressive strengths and durability properties of high volume slag (HVS) and high volume slag-fly ash (HVS-FA) blended concretes. The study examined the improvement in early and later age compressive strengths and durability properties such as sorptivity, volume of permeable voids, rapid chloride penetration and drying shrinkage of HVS concrete containing 69% blast furnace slag (BFS) and HVS-FA concrete containing combined BFS and fly ash (FA) content of 69% due to the addition of 1% NC. Results show that the addition of 1% NC improved the compressive strengths of HVS and HVS-FA concretes significantly by 43% and 28%, respectively at 3 days compared to the control HVS and HVS-FA concretes without NC and exceeded the compressive strengths of control OPC concrete at later ages. It is also found that 1% NC inclusion reduced the water sorptivity of HVS and HVS-FA concretes reasonably after 28 days of curing and reduction is greater after 90 days of curing exhibited comparable water sorptivity to OPC concrete. Significant improvement is also observed in reducing the volume of permeable voids and controlling the drying shrinkage strain at early age as well as later ages of both HVS and HVS-FA concretes due to 1% NC inclusion. Outstanding resistance against chloride ion penetration is also observed in HVS and HVS-FA concretes due to addition of 1% NC to the very low level of chloride ion penetration according to ASTM standard. SEM and EDS analysis revealed a denser microstructure of paste and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around aggregates.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a study on the use of high volume slag as a cement replacement material, and waste oil palm shell (OPS) as a lightweight aggregate to produce a sustainable lightweight concrete (LWC). In order to establish the feasibility of such concrete for structural purposes, the first part of the paper deals with the investigation of the mechanical and bond properties of OPS concrete (OPSC) with varying slag content. The results showed that even though an increase in the slag content led to the reduction in the strength, the OPSC with slag as a 60% cement replacement material exhibited compressive and splitting tensile strengths of 25 and 2.3 MPa, respectively, which exceeded the minimum stipulated strength required for structural LWC. In addition, the use of 60% slag in OPSC showed significant benefits in terms of the reduced cement consumption with improvement in the strength efficiency by almost 2-fold compared to that without slag. On the other hand, it was found that the slag content, albeit as high as a 60% cement replacement level, did not show any significant adverse effects on the normalized bond strength, failure mode, bond strength-slip curve and slip at the ultimate bond strength of the OPSC. To further justify the suitability of the OSPC for structural application, the second part of the paper focuses on the experimental investigation of the flexural behaviour of the actual full-scale reinforced concrete beams. From the flexural tests, it was observed that there were no negative effects on the ultimate moment capacity, failure mode and moment-deflection behaviour of the reinforced concrete beams upon cement replacement with up to 60% slag. Therefore, the utilization of high volume slag-lightweight OPSC could be recommended for actual structural purposes.},

In addition, the porosity and pore structure of sample surface were analyzed by X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), respectively. The results demonstrate that the largest rebound value of the concrete is obtained when the content of slag is 40%. Furthermore, the particle size and type of coarse aggregate have an effect on the rebound value of concrete. When the coarse aggregate is basalt and the particle size is between 10–20 mm, the rebound value is the largest. In addition, when the carbonation depth is large, the rebound strength of concrete with high volume slag is larger than that of the national unified strength curve. The establishment of rebound strength curve of concrete with high volume slag is helpful to improve the accuracy of compressive strength test of slag concrete.},

The pastes were exposed to elevated temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 800 °C with an increment of 200 °C for 2 h. Compressive strengths and pH values before and after firing were measured.

The results showed an increase in the reference compressive strength of HVS pastes with heat treatment up to 600 °C, then a reduction at 800 °C was observed. The relative compressive strength of HVS pastes was higher than that of 100% PC paste. The optimum slag content was 85% which exhibited residual compressive strength comparable to that of 100% PC at 600 °C and 800 °C.

In this paper, early age hydration progress and mechanical properties of concrete with high volume GGBS and FA were studied under different curing temperatures. The results show that high volume GGBS and FA accelerate the cement hydration in early age due to the dilution and filler effects. However, the hydration was slowed down when the addition of FA is up to 55% and 70%. Compared to binders with GGBS, the hydration process of binders with FA are more sensitive to temperature. The results also imply the necessity of the introduction of a range factor of hydration degree for effective estimation of Ea for binders with high volume of SCM. The equivalent age equation effectively predicts the early age strength development of high volume SCM concrete curing under changing temperature in an actual structure and what needed to do is to modify the activation energy by considering the hydration progress of binder with high volume SCM.},

The addition of gypsum increases early-age compressive strength and bound water content, but the opposite trend is observed at later ages. A higher quantity of gypsum leads to a higher third exothermic peak and a higher total hydration heat. Although incorporating gypsum promotes early hydration of cement and slag, it limits their further hydration at later ages. Adding gypsum forms a large amount of ettringite and densifies early-age pore structure, but it coarsens later-age pore structure. The addition of gypsum increases Ca/Si and S/Si ratios of C-S-H, but it doesn't affect Al/Si ratio. The addition of gypsum compensates for the poor early-age properties of composite binder containing high-volume slag and iron tailing powder, and the later-age properties are acceptable.},

The objective of this study is to present a numerical procedure that evaluates compressive strength and carbonation depth of high volume slag concrete. This numerical procedure consists of a blended hydration model and a carbonation reaction model. The amount of carbonatable materials, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), is calculated using the blended hydration model. Compressive strength development of cement-slag blends is evaluated from CSH content. By considering the effects of material properties and environmental conditions, the carbonation reaction model analyzes the diffusivity of carbon dioxide and the carbonation depth of concrete. The results of the analysis show that regarding compressive strength, the contribution of slag mixes prepared at a lower water to binder ratio was greater than the contribution of slag mixes prepared at a higher water to binder ratio. Regarding carbonation, with an increase in slag content or reducing the initial curing period, carbonation depth increases. The results of this study are useful for optimum mixing proportional design and carbonation durability design of concrete incorporating a high volume slag.},

   abstract = { When a hard spherical indenter is pressed into the surface of a softer metal, plastic flow of the metal specimen occurs and an indentation is formed. When the indenter is removed it is found that the permanent indentation is spherical in shape, but that its radius of curvature is greater than that of the indenter. It is generally held that this ‘shallowing’ effect is due to the release of elastic stresses in the material around the indentation. It is clear that if the recovery is truly elastic it should be reversible and that a second application and removal of the indenter under the original load should not change the size or shape of the indentation. Experiments show that this is the case. This means that when the original load is reapplied, the deformation of the indenter and the recovered indentation is elastic and should conform with Hertz’s equations for the elastic deformation of spherical surfaces. Measurements show that there is, in fact, close agreement between the observed deformation and that calculated from Hertz’s equations. These results have been applied to the case of indentations formed in a metal surface by an impacting indenter. The energy involved in the elastic recovery of the impacting surfaces is found to account for the energy of rebound of the indenter. This analysis explains a number of empirical relations observed in dynamic hardness measurements, and, in particular, reproduces the calibration characteristics of the rebound scleroscope. The results also show that for very soft metals the dynamic hardness is very much higher than the static hardness, and it is suggested that in rapid deformation of soft metals, forces of a quasi-viscous nature are involved. In the third part of the paper a simple theory of hardness is given, based on the theoretical work of Hencky and Ishlinsky. It is shown experimentally that for a material incapable of appreciable work-hardening, the mean pressure  P m  required to produce plastic yielding is related to the elastic limit Y of the material by a relation  P m  = cY , where c is a constant having a value between 2·6 and 3. An empirical method is described which takes into account the work-hardening produced in metals by the indentation process itself. This results in a general relation between hardness measurements and the stress-strain characteristic of the metal, and there is close agreement between the theory and the observed results. In addition, the theory explains the empirical laws of Meyer. },

However, the power-law exponent is not fixed at an integral value, as would be the case for elastic contact by a conical indenter (m = 2) or a flat circular punch (m = 1), but varies from material to material in the range m = 1.2-1.6. A simple model is developed based on observations from finite element simulations of indentation of elastic-plastic materials by a rigid cone that provides a physical explanation for the behavior. The model, which is based on the concept of an indenter with an "effective shape" whose geometry is determined by the shape of the plastic hardness impression formed during indentation, provides a means by which the material constant in the power law relation can be related to more fundamental material properties such as the elastic modulus and hardness. Simple arguments are presented from which the effective indenter shape can be derived from the pressure distribution under the indenter.},

   abstract = {As the input parameters in multiscale modeling the effective elastic modulus of the hardened cement paste, the elastic moduli of individual phases are crucial for assuring the accuracy of the homogenization estimate. In this study, the mechanical properties and the fractions of individual phases are measured by nanoindentation and back scattered electron image analysis, respectively. The mechanical properties of the hardened paste at microscale are measured by microindentation. The effect of individual phases including the CSH, the residual clinker and the capillary pore on the effective modulus of the hardened cement paste is quantified. It is found that the effective modulus of pore needs to be set as 12 GPa rather than 0 GPa as the input for homogenization. As for the solid phases, the variation of the clinker modulus has limited influence on the homogenized modulus of the hardened cement paste. Whereas, the homogenized paste modulus increases significantly with the increasing fraction of high density CSH and the decreasing fraction of low density CSH. The results of this study can help to select appropriate input parameters for multiscale modeling the mechanical properties of cementitious materials.},

   abstract = {Triethanolamine (TEA) is known as a widely-used cement additive for regulating setting time, hydration process and mechanical strength. However, the working mechanism of TEA on blended cement with various kinds of minerals, has not yet thoroughly explored. This invesitigation focused on effects of TEA on the strength enhancement and hydration properties of the blended cementitious materials, containing fly ash, slag, limestone. Hydration heat evolution of the composite binder was studied by isothermal calorimetry. Pore size distribution was analyzed through mercury injection porosimetry (MIP), and the evolution of hydration products in the function of TEA was investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and ther-mogravimetric analysis (TG). Microstructure and composition characteristics of hydration products were studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equiped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Results showed that strength enhancement effect of TEA varied when the component and proportion of cementitious materials altered. Containing 30% fly ash and 10% limestone, the composite binder got the optimal strength- enhancing effect to nearly 15%. When containing 30% slag and 10% fly ash, the composite binder obtained the worst strength-enhancing effect with about 5%. The addition of TEA prolonged the induction period, and enhanced the formation of AFt. With high aluminate glass phases, fly ash was vulnerable to be influenced by the complexation of TEA, and hence the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash was accelerated significantly, resulting in reduced content of Ca(OH)2 (CH) as well as increased production of hydrates. Limestone participated to accel-erate the hydration of C3A, and provided microcrystals for the growth of hydrates. Slag was mainly composed of high calcium glass phases and was rarely impacted by the complexation of TEA. The findings would gain a comprehensive insight of TEA in affecting the hydration process of blended materials, and would provide expedient information on the technique to control the hydration progress of composite binder.},

   abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

   abstract = {Unlike normal strength concretes, in which drying is the dominant form of shrinkage, in concretes with very low water to cement ratios autogenous and chemical shrinkage mechanisms can dominate. While the impact of specimen size and shape on drying shrinkage is well understood, the same is not true for autogenous and chemical shrinkage, and this lack of understanding may limit model precision and accuracy. To address this issue, this paper presents the results of a series of experiments conducted to measure the dependency of shrinkage of UPHC on specimen size. Results, recorded from 2 days after water addition, demonstrate a strong specimen size dependency when tested under both sealed and unsealed conditions, thereby indicating that the underlying mechanism is fundamentally different from normal strength concrete, with autogenous shrinkage exhibiting a large influence. Existing shrinkage models (AS3600, B4, CEB-FIP, GL2000 and ACI209) are evaluated for their potential calibration and/or extension to low water to binder ratio concretes and it is shown that commonly used parameters to account for size dependency in normal strength concrete (volume to surface area ratio and hypothetical thickness) do not capture size dependency in UHPC.},

   abstract = {<p>Cracking is a common problem in concrete structures in real-life service conditions. In fact, crack-free concrete structures are very rare to find in real world. Concrete can undergo early-age cracking depending on the mix composition, exposure environment, hydration rate, and curing conditions. Understanding the causes and consequences of cracking thoroughly is essential for selecting proper measures to resolve the early-age cracking problem in concrete. This paper will help to identify the major causes and consequences of the early-age cracking in concrete. Also, this paper will be useful to adopt effective remedial measures for reducing or eliminating the early-age cracking problem in concrete. Different types of early-age crack, the factors affecting the initiation and growth of early-age cracks, the causes of early-age cracking, and the modeling of early-age cracking are discussed in this paper. A number of examples for various early-age cracking problems of concrete found in different structural elements are also shown. Above all, some recommendations are given for minimizing the early-age cracking in concrete. It is hoped that the information conveyed in this paper will be beneficial to improve the service life of concrete structures. Concrete researchers and practitioners may benefit from the contents of this paper.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement can be used as an alternative binder in concrete, partially or fully replacing ordinary Portland cement. While CSA cement considerably accelerates the mechanical properties development, the rapid evolution of the microstructure together with the high water demand cause rapid and large volume changes at early ages. As volume changes may lead to early-age cracking, measures to reduce them may be required In this paper, autogenous and drying shrinkage are studied in mortars prepared with Portland cement, CSA cement or a 50/50 blend as binder. Very fast self-desiccation and high autogenous shrinkage of the CSA-based mortar were observed compared to the mortar made with Portland cement. On the other hand, the early-age volume changes can be limited if a blend of the two cements is used. The blended system revealed a bi-modal trend in the evolution of self-desiccation and autogenous shrinkage, in which the initial fast self-desiccation and shrinkage enter the dormant phase after the first couple of days and again start after about 28 days.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Tensile creep is an important factor affecting the early cracking resistance of concrete. The tensile creep model can effectively predict the development of tensile creep. In order to establish an appropriate tensile creep model, a temperature–stress testing machine (TSTM) was employed to test the development of temperature, deformation and restraint stress of benchmark concrete and concrete mixed with the MgO under different temperature curing modes. The development law of early age stress, strain and creep was analyzed via the test data of the TSTM. The early age tensile creep of concrete was predicted with the existing Kelvin creep model. The effect of variable temperature on creep was considered in this study, and an improved Kelvin creep model was proposed. The prediction accuracy of the two models was compared and analyzed. The results indicate that MgO has little influence on the creep and specific creep of concrete. The early age cracking resistance of MgO concrete is better than benchmark concrete. The improved Kelvin model based on the microprestress-solidification (MPS) theory predicts the early tensile creep of concrete more accurately in variable temperature conditions. These are significantly helpful for the application of the MgO expansion agent in dam engineering.</p>},

The fourth edition has been completely rewritten and updated to reflect advances in concrete technology over the past decade, yet it still retains the original aim of Professor Nevilles book: to provide reliable, comprehensive and practical information on the properties and use of concrete, and the selection of mix proportions, all based on scientific observations and the authors extensive engineering experience. The emphasis throughout is on understanding the behaviour of concrete and relating it to physical and chemical phenomena involved in the performance of the material in service. The overall effect is to give an integrated view of the properties of concrete so as to enable the reader to achieve the best possible construction in concrete. In addition, the scientific basis of the information provided is invaluable in planning research and in the interpretation of test results.new material includes such topics as various cementitious materials, high performance concrete, recently introduced admixtures, concrete under cryogenic conditions, properties of the aggregate-matrix interface, and durability of concrete under extreme conditions.incorporates a wealth of data from the latest relevant national and international standards and codes of practiceboth Sl and Imperial units are used throughoutincludes 1500 full references to the worlds literature on concretean extensive index containing over 6000 entries provides excellent ease-of-reference."With its many new additions, the book, at 844 pages is now an encyclopaedic tome, which is very reasonably priced.

   abstract = {<p>Concrete maturity theory has great potential in practical engineering. In this paper, the calculation and application of the concrete maturity are presented based on the qualitative analysis and quantitative calculations. Firstly, the maturity calculations are summarized by the methods of direct calculation and equivalent age calculation, as well as a theoretical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each calculation method. Secondly, the main methods of compressive strength and elastic modulus predicted by the concrete maturity are also summarized, and the calculation accuracy of the main calculation methods is compared with the published test results. Finally, based on actual engineering project, the research on concrete maturity is prospected to clarify the further research direction. The results show that the calculation methods of concrete maturity consist of direct calculation method and equivalent age calculation method, and the equivalent age calculation method is more reasonable in theory. Considering the wide range of construction temperature, the Freiesleben-Hansen equivalent age equation and exponential function prediction equation are recommended to predict the strength and elastic modulus of concrete.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Most of segmental prestressed concrete box girders exhibit excessive multidecade deflections unforeseeable by past and current design codes. To investigate such a behavior, mainly caused by creep and shrinkage phenomena, an effective finite element (FE) formulation is presented in this article. This formulation is developed by invoking the stationarity of an energetic principle for linear viscoelastic problems and relies on the Bazant creep constitutive law. A case study representative of segmental prestressed concrete box girders susceptible to creep is also analyzed in the article, that is, the Colle Isarco viaduct. Its FE model, based on the aforementioned energetic formulation, was successfully validated through the comparison with monitoring field data. As a result, the proposed 1D FE model can effectively reproduce the past behavior of the viaduct and predict its future behavior with a reasonable run time, which represents a decisive factor for the model implementation in a decision support system.</p>},

Four methods for converting creep compliance to relaxation modulus were discussed in detail and used for the one‐dimensional (1D) and three‐dimensional (3D) simulation of stress evolution in the Mini‐TSTM test. Furthermore, virtual creep and relaxation tests were conducted using an exponential algorithm with either the Kelvin or Maxwell chains to show their applicability in simulating the viscoelastic behavior of early‐age cementitious materials. The results showed that the exponential algorithm with the Maxwell chain using an exponential conversion function from creep to relaxation obtains good prediction accuracy of EAS in 3D analysis. The numerical solutions of the Volterra integral of creep compliance can lead to a negative relaxation modulus, thus introducing stress calculation errors in both 1D and 3D analysis.</p>},

   abstract = {Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have recently demonstrated impressive results on various generative tasks.Despite its promises, the learned representations of pre-trained DPMs, however, have not been fully understood. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the representation power of DPMs, and propose a novel knowledge transfer method that leverages the knowledge acquired by generative DPMs for recognition tasks. Our study begins by examining the feature space of DPMs, revealing that DPMs are inherently denoising autoencoders that balance the representation learning with regularizing model capacity. To this end, we introduce a novel knowledge transfer paradigm named RepFusion. Our paradigm extracts representations at different time steps from off-the-shelf DPMs and dynamically employs them as supervision for student networks, in which the optimal time is determined through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach on several image classification, semantic segmentation, and landmark detection benchmarks, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our results uncover the potential of DPMs as a powerful tool for representation learning and provide insights into the usefulness of generative models beyond sample generation. The code is available at \url\{https://github.com/Adamdad/Repfusion\}.},

   abstract = {The microstructure is significant for exploring the physical properties of hardened cement paste. In general, the microstructures of hardened cement paste are obtained by microscopy. As a popular method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can acquire high-quality 2D images but fails to obtain 3D microstructures.Although several methods, such as microtomography (Micro-CT) and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), can acquire 3D microstructures, these fail to obtain high-quality 3D images or consume considerable cost. To address these issues, a method based on solid texture synthesis is proposed, synthesizing high-quality 3D microstructural image of hardened cement paste. This method includes 2D backscattered electron (BSE) image acquisition and 3D microstructure synthesis phases. In the approach, the synthesis model is based on solid texture synthesis, capturing microstructure information of the acquired 2D BSE image and generating high-quality 3D microstructures. In experiments, the method is verified on actual 3D Micro-CT images and 2D BSE images. Finally, qualitative experiments demonstrate that the 3D microstructures generated by our method have similar visual characteristics to the given 2D example. Furthermore, quantitative experiments prove that the synthetic 3D results are consistent with the actual instance in terms of porosity, particle size distribution, and grey scale co-occurrence matrix.},

Confronting the limitations of variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network within generative models, this study adopted the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to learn the probability distribution of high-dimensional raw data and successfully reconstructed the microstructures of various composite materials, such as inclusion materials, spinodal decomposition materials, chessboard materials, fractal noise materials, and so on. The quality of generated microstructure was evaluated using quantitative measures like spatial correlation functions and Fourier descriptor. On this basis, this study also achieved the regulation of microstructure randomness and the generation of gradient materials through continuous interpolation in latent space using denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM). Furthermore, the two-dimensional microstructure reconstruction was extended to three-dimensional framework and integrated permeability as a feature encoding embedding. This enables the conditional generation of three-dimensional microstructures for random porous materials within a defined permeability range. The permeabilities of these generated microstructures were further validated through the application of the lattice Boltzmann method.

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

While their tailorable properties have been explored extensively, the design of truss-based metamaterials has remained highly limited and often heuristic, due to the vast, discrete design space and the lack of a comprehensive parameterization. We here present a graph-based deep learning generative framework, which combines a variational autoencoder and a property predictor, to construct a reduced, continuous latent representation covering an enormous range of trusses. This unified latent space allows for the fast generation of new designs through simple operations (e.g., traversing the latent space or interpolating between structures). We further demonstrate an optimization framework for the inverse design of trusses with customized mechanical properties in both the linear and nonlinear regimes, including designs exhibiting exceptionally stiff, auxetic, pentamode-like, and tailored nonlinear behaviors. This generative model can predict manufacturable (and counter-intuitive) designs with extreme target properties beyond the training domain.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The sensitivity of heterogeneous energetic (HE) materials (propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics) is critically dependent on their microstructure. Initiation of chemical reactions occurs at hot spots due to energy localization at sites of porosities and other defects. Emerging multi-scale predictive models of HE response to loads account for the physics at the meso-scale, i.e. at the scale of statistically representative clusters of particles and other features in the microstructure. Meso-scale physics is infused in machine-learned closure models informed by resolved meso-scale simulations. Since microstructures are stochastic, ensembles of meso-scale simulations are required to quantify hot spot ignition and growth and to develop models for microstructure-dependent energy deposition rates. We propose utilizing generative adversarial networks (GAN) to spawn ensembles of synthetic heterogeneous energetic material microstructures. The method generates qualitatively and quantitatively realistic microstructures by learning from images of HE microstructures. We show that the proposed GAN method also permits the generation of new morphologies, where the porosity distribution can be controlled and spatially manipulated. Such control paves the way for the design of novel microstructures to engineer HE materials for targeted performance in a materials-by-design framework.</p>},

These materials have a bimodal polycrystalline microstructure composed of recrystallized ultra-fine grains (UFGs) and deformed coarse grains (CGs) within prior particles. A prime reason is the lack of robust approaches for generating statistically equivalent virtual microstructures (SEVM) capturing the statistics of characteristic morphological and crystallographic features, such as grain size, crystallographic orientations, and misorientations. This paper introduces an approach, strategically integrating Generative Adversarial Network-based approaches for producing bimodal CSF AA7050 alloy microstructures, with the synthetic microstructure builder Dream3D for packing prior particles with CGs having statistically equivalent morphological and crystallographic descriptors to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps.

However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256$\times$256 pixels. The source code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/NVAE .},

   abstract = {Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in the development of deep learning, enabling various networks to train. However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern libraries.},

Two decades after Tesauro's TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU). The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and softmax action selection with simple annealing can be competitive with DQN, without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10$\times$10 board, using TD($\lambda$) learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa($\lambda$) agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units.},

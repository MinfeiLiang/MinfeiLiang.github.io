   abstract = {This study aims to provide an efficient and accurate machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the creep behavior of concrete. Three ensemble machine learning (EML) models are selected in this study: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). Firstly, the creep data in Northwestern University (NU) database is preprocessed by a prebuilt XGBoost model and then split into a training set and a testing set. Then, by Bayesian Optimization and 5-fold cross validation, the 3 EML models are tuned to achieve high accuracy (R2 = 0.953, 0.947 and 0.946 for LGBM, XGBoost and RF, respectively). In the testing set, the EML models show significantly higher accuracy than the equation proposed by the fib Model Code 2010 (R2 = 0.377). Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), based on the cooperative game theories, are calculated to interpretate the predictions of the EML model. Five most influential parameters for concrete creep compliance are identified by the SHAP values of EML models as follows: time since loading, compressive strength, age when loads are applied, relative humidity during the test and temperature during the test. The patterns captured by the three EML models are consistent with theoretical understanding of factors that influence concrete creep, which proves that the proposed EML models show reasonable predictions.},

   abstract = {This study aims to provide an efficient alternative for predicting creep modulus of cement paste based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). First, a microscale lattice model for short-term creep is adopted to build a database that contains 18,920 samples. Then, 3 DCNNs with different consecutive convolutional layers are built to learn from the database. Finally, the performance of DCNNs is tested on unseen testing samples. The results show that the DCNNs can achieve high accuracy in the testing set, with the R2 all higher than 0.96. The distribution of creep modulus predicted by the DCNNs coincides with that of the original data. Furthermore, through analyzing the feature maps, it is found that the DCNNs can correctly capture the local importance of different microstructural phases. The DCNN allows therefore prediction of the creep modulus based on microstructural input, which saves computational resources of segmentation procedure and multiple incremental FEM calculations.},

   abstract = {Stress evolution of restrained concrete is a significant direct index in early-age cracking (EAC) analysis of concrete. This study presents experiments and numerical modelling of the early-age stress evolution of Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) concrete, considering the development of autogenous deformation and creep. Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM) tests were conducted to obtain the autogenous deformation and stress evolution of restrained GGBFS concrete. By a self-defined material subroutine based on the Rate-type creep law, the FEM model for simulating the stress evolution in TSTM tests was established. By characterizing the creep compliance function with a 13-units continuous Kelvin chain, forward modelling was firstly conducted to predict the stress development. Then inverse modelling was conducted by Bayesian Optimization to efficiently modify the arbitrary assumption of the codes on the aging creep. The major findings of this study are as follows: 1) the high autogenous expansion of GGBFS induces compressive stress at first hours, but its value is low because of high relaxation and low elastic modulus; 2) The codes highly underestimated the early-age creep of GGBFS concrete. They performed well in prediction of stress after 200 h, but showed significant gaps in predictions of early-age stress evolution; 3) The proposed inverse modelling method with Bayesian Optimization can efficiently adjusted the aging terms which produced best modelling results. The adjusted creep compliance function of GGBFS showed a much faster aging speed at early ages than the one proposed by original codes.},

Images of 2D microstructures of cement pastes obtained from XCT tests are used as inputs and mapped to the lattice model. Different local mechanical and fatigue properties are assigned to different phases of the cement paste. A cyclic constitutive law is proposed for considering the fatigue damage evolution. Fatigue experiments performed at the same length scale are used to calibrate and validate the model. The proposed model can reproduce well the flexural fatigue experimental results, in terms of S-N curve, stiffness degradation and residual deformation. The validated model is then used to predict the uniaxial tensile fatigue fracture of cement paste. The effects of microstructure and stress level on the fatigue fracture are studied using the proposed model. This model forms a basis for the multiscale analysis of concrete fatigue.},

   abstract = {<p> Early‐age stress (EAS) is an important index for evaluating the early‐age cracking risk of concrete. This paper encompasses a thermo‐chemo‐mechanical (TCM) model and active ensemble learning (AEL) for predicting the EAS evolution. The TCM model provides the data for the AEL model. First, based on Fourier's law, Arrhenius’ equation, and rate‐type creep law, a TCM model is built to simulate the heat transfer, cement hydration, and viscoelasticity, which together determine the EAS evolution. Then, a material model composed of an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model and adjusted Model Code 2010 is built to allow for parametric study and database construction. Finally, an AEL framework is built, which incorporates principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian process, and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM). This study resulted in the following findings: (1) The dimensionality of the 672‐by‐1 EAS vector can be effectively reduced by PCA, and the first principal component (PC) is a global index representing the magnitude of the EAS; (2) the mechanical field of the TCM model is validated by testing data. Correlation analysis on the first PC quantifies the influence of various input parameters of the TCM model, which is in accordance with common understandings of the EAS evolution process. (3) The AEL and one‐shot ensemble learning (OSEL) both achieve high prediction performance in the testing set, whose <italic>R</italic> <sup>2</sup> reaches 0.961 and 0.948, respectively. Thanks to the uncertainty‐based query procedure, comparing with OSEL, AEL shows advantages in prediction performance over the whole training history. (4) AEL can significantly reduce the number of samples required for training, which can be a major improvement in efficiency considering the computational cost of the TCM model. </p>},

Four methods for converting creep compliance to relaxation modulus were discussed in detail and used for the one‐dimensional (1D) and three‐dimensional (3D) simulation of stress evolution in the Mini‐TSTM test. Furthermore, virtual creep and relaxation tests were conducted using an exponential algorithm with either the Kelvin or Maxwell chains to show their applicability in simulating the viscoelastic behavior of early‐age cementitious materials. The results showed that the exponential algorithm with the Maxwell chain using an exponential conversion function from creep to relaxation obtains good prediction accuracy of EAS in 3D analysis. The numerical solutions of the Volterra integral of creep compliance can lead to a negative relaxation modulus, thus introducing stress calculation errors in both 1D and 3D analysis.</p>},

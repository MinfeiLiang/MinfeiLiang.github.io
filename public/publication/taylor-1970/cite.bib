 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the development of a computational algorithm for the solution of the uncoupled, quasi-static boundary value problem for a linear viscoelastic solid undergoing thermal and mechanical deformation. The method evolves from a finite element discretization of a stationary value problem, leading to the solution of a system of linear integral equations determining the motion of the solid. An illustrative example is included.},

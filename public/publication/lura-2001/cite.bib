 abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the influence of curing temperature and type of cement [Portland cement and blast-furnace slag (BFS) cement] on the autogenous deformations and self-induced stresses in early-age concrete. It was found that higher temperatures do not lead to higher deformations in the observed period, but generally cause a faster shrinkage and a faster development of self-induced stresses. Another experimental finding is that, at the temperatures tested, concrete made with BFS cement shows higher shrinkage in the first days than concrete made with Portland cement.

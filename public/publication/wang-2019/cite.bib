 abstract = {A new relaxation function and a new age-adjusted effective modulus expression of concrete are derived by applying the integral mean value theorem in mathematics to the integral equation of creep analysis. Expressions of the age adjusting coefficient used for prediction of relaxation function and age-adjusted effective modulus in the derived expressions are presented based on the creep models in the fib Model Code 2010 and ACI 209 2R-08 report. It is indicated that the results of relaxation function and age-adjusted effective modulus predicted by the derived expressions are in good agreement with those computed by the step by step method. Because the age-adjusted effective modulus is insensitive to the variation of the age adjusting coefficient, thus simplified equations for calculation of age adjusting coefficient are also established. An example of a two-span bridge is presented to show the application of the proposed age-adjusted effective modulus for moment redistribution analysis.},

 abstract = {The macroscopic elastic moduli of two-phase composites are estimated by a method that takes account of the inhomogeneity of stress and strain in a way similar to the Hershey-Kröner theory of crystalline aggregates. The phases may be arbitrarily aeolotropic and in any concentrations, but are required to have the character of a matrix and effectively ellipsoidal inclusions. Detailed results arc given for an isotropic dispersion of spheres. © 1965.},

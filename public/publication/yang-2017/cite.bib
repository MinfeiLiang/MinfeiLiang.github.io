 abstract = {<p>Plain cement concrete, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) concrete, and fly ash concrete were designed. Three wet curing periods were employed, which were 2, 5, and 8 days. The drying shrinkage values of the concretes were measured within 1 year after wet curing. The results show that the increasing rate of the drying shrinkage of concrete containing a mineral admixture at late age is higher than that of plain cement concrete regardless of the wet curing time. With the reduction of wet curing time, the increment of total drying shrinkage of concrete decreases with the decrease of the W/B ratio. The negative effects on the drying shrinkage of fly ash concrete due to the reduction of the wet curing time are much more obvious than those of GGBS concrete and plain cement concrete. Superfine ground granulated blast furnace slag (SGGBS) can reduce the drying shrinkage of GGBS concrete and fly ash concrete when the wet curing time is insufficient.</p>},

 abstract = {The aging aspect of basic creep of concrete can be mathematically handled by the solidification theory in which the material parameters for creep are considered to be age-independent but the volume fraction of the age-independent material increases with age. The solidification theory is formulated with a Kelvin chain model of infinite number of Kelvin units. The identification of this model from the measured creep curves of concrete and its conversion into a model with finite number of Kelvin units for numerical computations is shown.},

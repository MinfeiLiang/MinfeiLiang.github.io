 abstract = {A recent scientific and industrial interest has been brought to combine multiple supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in large quantities in concrete binders. The growing use of binary, ternary or quaternary cement binders calls for the development of simple, efficient and accurate experimental means to characterise and predict the behaviour of such concretes. Continuous non-destructive testing constitutes a major opportunity since it generally consists in simple test setup requiring low human interaction. In this study, isothermal calorimetry and ultrasonic pulse velocity (compression and shear waves) are performed on various concrete compositions with massive incorporation of limestone filler and blast-furnace slag. Indeed, these two additions present interesting complementary effects and positive synergies in terms of fresh properties, mechanical behaviour and durability potential. The hydration process of these concretes is investigated, and a new model is presented for representing the hydration degree of SCM-based binders. Then, the apparent activation energy is studied through tests at various temperature. Ultrasonic measurements are shown to provide a good alternative to isothermal calorimetry for the monitoring of the apparent activation energy of concrete during the first days of hydration.},

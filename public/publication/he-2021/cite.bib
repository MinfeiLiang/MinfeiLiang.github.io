 abstract = {Triethanolamine (TEA) is known as a widely-used cement additive for regulating setting time, hydration process and mechanical strength. However, the working mechanism of TEA on blended cement with various kinds of minerals, has not yet thoroughly explored. This invesitigation focused on effects of TEA on the strength enhancement and hydration properties of the blended cementitious materials, containing fly ash, slag, limestone. Hydration heat evolution of the composite binder was studied by isothermal calorimetry. Pore size distribution was analyzed through mercury injection porosimetry (MIP), and the evolution of hydration products in the function of TEA was investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and ther-mogravimetric analysis (TG). Microstructure and composition characteristics of hydration products were studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equiped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Results showed that strength enhancement effect of TEA varied when the component and proportion of cementitious materials altered. Containing 30% fly ash and 10% limestone, the composite binder got the optimal strength- enhancing effect to nearly 15%. When containing 30% slag and 10% fly ash, the composite binder obtained the worst strength-enhancing effect with about 5%. The addition of TEA prolonged the induction period, and enhanced the formation of AFt. With high aluminate glass phases, fly ash was vulnerable to be influenced by the complexation of TEA, and hence the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash was accelerated significantly, resulting in reduced content of Ca(OH)2 (CH) as well as increased production of hydrates. Limestone participated to accel-erate the hydration of C3A, and provided microcrystals for the growth of hydrates. Slag was mainly composed of high calcium glass phases and was rarely impacted by the complexation of TEA. The findings would gain a comprehensive insight of TEA in affecting the hydration process of blended materials, and would provide expedient information on the technique to control the hydration progress of composite binder.},

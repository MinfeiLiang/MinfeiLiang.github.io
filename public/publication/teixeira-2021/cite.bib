 abstract = {The present work reviews the implementation of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis with emphasis in four main types of metamodels: response surfaces, polynomial chaos expansions, support vector machines, and Kriging models. The discussion presented is motivated by the identified spread and little interaction between metamodeling techniques in reliability, which makes it challenging for practitioners to decide which one to consider in a context of implementation. The conceptual problem of reliability analysis and the theoretical description of the four models is presented, and complemented by a comparative discussion of applications with identification of new areas of interest. The different considerations that influence the efficiency of adaptive metamodeling are reviewed, with extension to applicability discussions for the four models researched. Despite all adaptive techniques contributing to achieve significant gains in the amount of effort required for reliability analysis, and with minimal trade-off in accuracy, they should not be expected to perform equally in regard to the dependence on the reliability problem being addressed. Cross application of methodologies, bridging the gap between methodology and application, and ensembles are some of new areas of research interest identified. One of the major critical considerations for adaptive metamodeling, and that has been target of limited research, is the need for comprehensive techniques that allow a blind selection of the most adequate model with relation to the problem inâ€“hand. To conclude, the extensive and comprehensive discussion presented aims to be a first step for the unification of the field of adaptive metamodeling in reliability; so that future implementations do not exclusively follow individual lines of research that progressively become more narrow in scope, but also seek transversal developments in the field of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis.},

 abstract = {To assess the effect of relative humidity (RH) on drying-induced damage in concrete, the non-uniform strains and microcracks in concrete under different RH conditions were obtained using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique and lattice fracture model. The simulated non-uniform displacements were consistent with those captured using DIC. A new damage index was proposed by considering all the subsets with equivalent strain larger than the threshold tensile strength. The calculated damage index showed good correlation with the microcracks' total area and indicated that RH equal or lower than 55% could cause relatively high cracking risk. This work provides an attractive method for quantifying drying-induced damage in concrete using the DIC technique.},

 abstract = {At early age, massive structures are prone to thermal cracking and may be damaged by the restraint of the thermal strain. Thermal and mechanical analysis have to be relevant to perform reliable numerical simulations. However, some uncertainties still remains: for instance, the values of the creep's compliance differed in the literature. Creep strains modeling is performed by a rheological model, the evolution of hydration, the long term viscoelasticity and the asymmetry of the behavior between tension and compression are taken into account. The influence of this dissymmetry is assessed throughout the casting of a massive wall on a raft foundation. The results show that the final damage field is highly dependent on the value of this dissymetry.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study of the properties of a high-performance Portland cement paste (w/c ratio 0.37; 5% silica fume) cured at 20 °C in sealed conditions for 5 days. Properties such as electrical conductivity, strength, stiffness, porosity, Vicat penetration, and autogenous deformation were measured and modelled. The kinetics of hydration was studied by means of isothermal calorimetry. The numerical simulations were performed with CEMHYD3D, developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and HYMOSTRUC, developed at the Delft University of Technology. The results of the simulations were compared with experimental data, and the match was good. Clear correlations were found among electrical conductivity, autogenous shrinkage, and connectivity of solids. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

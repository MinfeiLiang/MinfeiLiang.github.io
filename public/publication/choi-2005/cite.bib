 abstract = {This paper describes an experimental investigation into the relationship between the splitting tensile strength and compressive strength of glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC). The splitting tensile strength and compressive strength of GFRC and PFRC at 7, 28 and 90 days are used. Test results indicate that the addition of glass and polypropylene fibers to concrete increased the splitting tensile strength of concrete by approximately 20-50%, and the splitting tensile strength of GFRC and PFRC ranged from 9% to 13% of its compressive strength. Based on this investigation, a simple 0.5 power relationship between the splitting tensile strength and the compressive strength was derived for estimating the tensile strength of GFRC and PFRC.

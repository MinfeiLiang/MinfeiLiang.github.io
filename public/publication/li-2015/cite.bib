 abstract = {The early-age volume deformation and cracking of sidewall concrete is the result of the concerted action of multi-factors containing chemical, hygral, thermal and mechanical changes. In this paper, a multi-field (hygro-thermo-chemo-mechanical) coupling model based on Fourier's law, Fick's law, mass and energy balance equations, was adopted to describe the cement hydration, temperature and humidity evolution for early-age sidewall concrete, and thermal, hygral deformations and cracking risk were obtained by further combining with shrinkage description for partially saturated porous solids and a widely used crack criterion. The effects of foundation constraint and early-age creep of concrete on deformation and cracking were also considered. Based on the multi-field coupling model, the cracking risk of sidewall concrete members with two typical concrete mixes before the removal of wooden formwork was evaluated in this paper, providing insight into the influence of parameters such as concrete mix and pouring lengths on the cracking risk of early-age concrete.},

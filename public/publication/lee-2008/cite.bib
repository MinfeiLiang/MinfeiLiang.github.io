 abstract = {The effect of interfacial transition zone on mechanical properties of concrete has been found to be significant, thus the interfacial transition zone should be considered in the analysis for better estimation of elastic modulus of concrete. However, it is difficult to estimate elastic modulus of concrete practically using simple models proposed so far. In this study, a numerical concrete model that adopts three-phase model and finite element with material discontinuity was proposed to analyze concrete with complex interface in three dimensions. The validity of the proposed model was verified by comparing the calculated elastic moduli of concrete with those obtained from experiments. The effect of interfacial transition zone on elastic modulus of concrete with either low or high w/c was also investigated. The analysis results suggest that careful selection of characteristics for interfacial transition zone should be made for the accurate estimation of elastic modulus of concrete. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried out to study the influence of industrial slag on the rheological, self-compactability and strength properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) incorporating high volume replacements of industrial slag up to 90%. The rheological properties such as plastic viscosity and yield stress were evaluated using ICAR rheometer. The effect of high range water reducing admixture (HRWR) dosage, and the self-compactability properties such as T50, slump flow, V-funnel flow times and L-box blocking ratio were also investigated. The results illustrated that plastic viscosity decreased with the increase of the percentage of slag and the yield stress was nearly zero for all the replacements studied. The compressive strengths determined for the SCCs demonstrated that high strength SCC of more than 100 MPa at 30% and low strength SCC of 20 MPa at 90% replacement can be realized by utilizing slag appropriately.},

 abstract = {A powerful and now theoretical approach is used to obtain an expression for the effect of creep on reinforced concrete shear deform able beams. First, a method is proposed for Ruler-Bernoulli beam to analyze the long-term behavior of concrete beams based on linear strain theory. Second, a formulation has been developed to analyze the strain distribution in shear deformablo concrete beams. Finally, three numerical examples are included in order to compare well-known codes with the proposed method. The comparison of the proposed method, FEM, codes, and experimental works demonstrates that the proposed analytical procedure can effectively simulate creep behavior of reinforced concrete beams.},

 abstract = {Autogenous shrinkage (AS) of high-strength and high-performance concrete (HSHPC) is large, which easily leads to early-age cracks and then severely deteriorates the concrete durability. CaO-based expansive agent (CEA) is extensively applied to mitigate the AS of HSHPC, but CEA could not fully achieve its expansion efficacy in HSHPC because of its low water to binder ratio and water amount, causing that CEA hydrates incompletely and the concrete contracts sharply and substantially after the initial expansion. Pre-wetted ceramsite (PWC), as an internal curing agent, could decrease effectively the AS of HSHPC. Based on the mechanism of AS reduction of CEA and PWC, the combination use of CEA and PWC could reach a synergistic effect on AS in HSHPC. However, there still lacks a synthetic study on the effects of the compound use of PWC and CEA on the mechanical properties and autogenous deformation of concrete. Thus, this study carried out the experiments on mechanical behaviors and autogenous deformation of concrete with PWC or/and CEA addition. The test results claimed that the PWC addition enhanced the compressive and splitting tensile strength while the opposite results were obtained by CEA addition. In addition, both PWC and CEA addition weakened the dynamic elastic modulus of concrete. Meanwhile, the PWC and CEA incorporation had a significant improving effect on the internal relative humidity in concrete. The AS of concrete was greatly mitigated by PWC addition. The IC water of PWC could improve the expansion efficacy of CEA as well as greatly decrease the contraction at the later stage. A remarkable synergistic mechanism on AS mitigation was observed with the combined use of PWC and CEA, which is significantly beneficial to control the AS-induced cracking.},

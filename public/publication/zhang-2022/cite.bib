 abstract = {In this paper, both synthetic slag and commercial slag covering the common composition range were employed to estimate the correlation between slag chemistry and reactivity through hydraulicity and dissolution tests. It was found that slag reactivity was favorably affected by increasing Al2O3 and MgO contents, while the adverse effect of decreasing CaO/SiO2 ratio could be compensated by higher amounts of Al2O3 and/or MgO. When calorimetric measurement was used to assess the reactivity of slag, the effect of sulfur species incorporated in commercial slag should be taken into consideration as a small quantity of it could lead to a major difference of cumulative heat release due to the formation of ettringite. Moreover, a novel graphical method was proposed to estimate the reactivity of slag considering its chemical composition from a new perspective, i.e. a cartesian coordinate system based on (CaO/SiO2)−(MgO + Al2O3).},

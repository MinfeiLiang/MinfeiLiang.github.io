 abstract = {Ground granulated blast furnace slag, which shows cementitious behavior (latent hydraulic activity) and pozzolanic characteristics (reaction with lime), has been widely used as a mineral admixture in normal and high strength concretes. Hydration of slag-blended cement is much more complex than that of ordinary Portland cement because of the mutual interactions between the cement hydration and the slag reaction. This paper presents a kinetic hydration model for cement-slag blends. The proposed model analyzes the slag reaction separate from cement hydration by considering the production of calcium hydroxide in cement hydration and its consumption in slag reactions. The amount of free water and the amount of calcium hydroxide left in the system were adopted as the control indicators for determining the slag reaction. Using the proposed model, the reaction ratio of slag can be evaluated as a function of curing age, considering the influences of the water to binder ratio, the slag replacement ratio and the curing temperature. Furthermore, the amount of chemically-bound water (self-cementing properties), calcium hydroxide (pozzolanic capabilities), and the heat released from hydration are evaluated by determining the contributions from both the cement hydration and the slag reaction. The evaluated results show good accordance with the experimental results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {This study is dedicated to comparing minutes-long microindentation creep experiments on cement paste with years-long macroscopic creep experiments on concrete and months-long macroscopic creep experiments on cement paste. For all experiments, after a transient period the creep function was well captured by a logarithmic function of time, the amplitude of which is governed by a so-called creep modulus. The non-logarithmic transient periods lasted for days at the macroscopic scale, but only for seconds at the scale of microindentation. The creep moduli (which thus govern the rate of the long-term logarithmic creep) of concrete samples were estimated from microindentations performed at the scale of cement pastes in combination with micro-mechanical models. Those estimates were proportional to the creep moduli measured on concrete samples by regular macroscopic uniaxial testing, thus proving that minutes-long microindentation can provide a measurement of the long-term creep properties of cementitious materials.

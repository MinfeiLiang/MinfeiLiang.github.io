 abstract = {This paper presents a 12-year-long creep and shrinkage experimental campaign on cylindrical and prismatic concrete samples under uniaxial and biaxial stress, respectively. The motivation for the study is the need for predicting the delayed strains and the pre-stress loss of concrete containment buildings of nuclear power plants. Two subjects are central in this regard: the creep strain's long-term evolution and the creep Poisson's ratio. A greater understanding of these areas is necessary to ensure reliable predictions of the long-term behavior of the concrete containment buildings. Long-term basic creep appears to evolve as a logarithm function of time in the range of 3 to 10 years of testing. Similar trends are observed for drying creep, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage testing, which suggests that all delayed strains obtained using different loading and drying conditions originate from a common mechanism. The creep Poisson's ratio derived from the biaxial tests is approximately constant over time for both the basic and drying creep tests (creep strains corrected by the shrinkage strain). It is also shown that the biaxial non-drying samples undergo a significant increase in Young's modulus after 10 years.},

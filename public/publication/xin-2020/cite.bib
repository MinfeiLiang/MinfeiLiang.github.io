 abstract = {This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of uniaxial restraint tests for evaluation of behavior and cracking potential of early-age cementitious systems in the last five decades. Histories of design concept and improvement of uniaxial restraint tests (longitudinal-passive and longitudinal-active test) have been introduced. Particularly, analytical methods of restraint degree and restrained stress, sensitivity analysis of uniaxial restraint test parameter, as well as cracking potential evaluation with respect to their application rationalities are addressed, which are extended contents compared with the last review in early 2000s. Finally, challenges and perspectives of uniaxial restraint tests for evaluation of behavior and cracking potential of cementitious systems are given for future improvement.},

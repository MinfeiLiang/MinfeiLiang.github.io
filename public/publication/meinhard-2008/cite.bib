 abstract = {Recently, the heat release during cement hydration and the so-caused temperature rise was exploited for (i) identification of material properties of early-age cement-based materials (stiffness, strength), and (ii) determination of the diameter and the cement content of jet-grouted structures. In this paper, the underlying hydration model for determination of the heat release and its rate is refined for Ordinary Portland Cements (OPC) and extended towards blended cements. Hereby, the overall degree of hydration with one kinetic law is replaced by a multi-phase hydration model, taking the hydration kinetics of the main clinker phases into account. As regards blended cements, which are commonly used in engineering practice, the effect of slag hydration is incorporated into the presented multi-phase model. The developed hydration model for both plain and blended cement is validated by means of differential-calorimetry (DC) experiments. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

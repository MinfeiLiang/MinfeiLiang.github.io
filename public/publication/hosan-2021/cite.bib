 abstract = {This paper presents the effect of nano-CaCO3 (NC) on the compressive strengths and durability properties of high volume slag (HVS) and high volume slag-fly ash (HVS-FA) blended concretes. The study examined the improvement in early and later age compressive strengths and durability properties such as sorptivity, volume of permeable voids, rapid chloride penetration and drying shrinkage of HVS concrete containing 69% blast furnace slag (BFS) and HVS-FA concrete containing combined BFS and fly ash (FA) content of 69% due to the addition of 1% NC. Results show that the addition of 1% NC improved the compressive strengths of HVS and HVS-FA concretes significantly by 43% and 28%, respectively at 3 days compared to the control HVS and HVS-FA concretes without NC and exceeded the compressive strengths of control OPC concrete at later ages. It is also found that 1% NC inclusion reduced the water sorptivity of HVS and HVS-FA concretes reasonably after 28 days of curing and reduction is greater after 90 days of curing exhibited comparable water sorptivity to OPC concrete. Significant improvement is also observed in reducing the volume of permeable voids and controlling the drying shrinkage strain at early age as well as later ages of both HVS and HVS-FA concretes due to 1% NC inclusion. Outstanding resistance against chloride ion penetration is also observed in HVS and HVS-FA concretes due to addition of 1% NC to the very low level of chloride ion penetration according to ASTM standard. SEM and EDS analysis revealed a denser microstructure of paste and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around aggregates.},

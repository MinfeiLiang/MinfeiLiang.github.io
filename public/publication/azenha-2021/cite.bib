 abstract = {These recommendations have been prepared by the corresponding working group within RILEM TC 287-CCS “Early-age and long-term crack width analysis in RC structures”, following work by the previously ceased RILEM TC 254-CMS “Thermal cracking of massive concrete structures”. This recommendations document is developed in complementarity to the state-of-the-art report of RILEM TC 254-CMS and aims to provide expert advice and suggestions to engineers and scientists interested in modelling the thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviour of massive concrete structures since concrete casting. Recommendations regarding geometrical characteristics and complexities, concrete properties and appropriate material models, boundary conditions and loads, and numerical model peculiarities with relevance to the simulation of the thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviour of massive concrete structures are given herein. The recommendations have been reviewed and approved by all members of the TC 287-CCS.},

 abstract = {The strength development of mortars containing ground granulated blast-furnace slag (ggbs) and portland cement was investigated. Variables were the level of ggbs in the binder, water-binder ratio and curing temperature. All mortars gain strength more rapidly at higher temperatures and have a lower calculated ultimate strength. The early age strength is much more sensitive to temperature for higher levels of ground granulated blast-furnace slag. The calculated ultimate strength is affected to a similar degree for all ggbs levels and water-binder ratios, with only the curing temperature having a significant effect. Apparent activation energies were determined according to ASTM C1074 and were found to vary approximately linearly with ggbs level from 34 kJ/mol for portland cement mortars to around 60 kJ/mol for mortars containing 70% ggbs. The water-binder ratio appears to have little or no effect on the apparent activation energy. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

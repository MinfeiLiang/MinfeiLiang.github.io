From January 21 to 23, 2025, the ZEBAI (Zero-Emission Buildings enhanced by Artificial Intelligence) Project successfully held its 2nd General Assembly at the University of Birmingham, bringing together researchers and partners to discuss the progress and future directions of AI-powered zero-emission building design.

It was a pleasure to attend the meeting at the University of Birmingham and meet Dr. Stergios-Aristoteles Mitoulis and Dr. Mohammad Reza Salami. Moving forward, we will collaborate on material mechanics testing within the ZEBAI project. Additionally, I will be developing an AI-FEM simulation tool to optimize the mechanical performance of low-carbon building materials, contributing to more efficient and sustainable structural designs.

Exciting developments lie ahead as we work together towards innovative solutions in sustainable construction!

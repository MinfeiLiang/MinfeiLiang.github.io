Last week, we successfully organized the Concreep12 conference at TU Delft. As a recent PhD graduate, I had the privilege of being part of the organizing team and presenting my research on early-age cracking of concrete. 

I extend my heartfelt thanks to Erik Schlangen, Branko Å avija, Iris Batterham, and my wonderful friends and colleagues at the Microlab. It was a pleasure to meet and converse with so many outstanding researchers, exchanging research experiences and ideas. I look forward to meeting you and continuing our discussions in the future.

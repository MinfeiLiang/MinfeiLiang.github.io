I am glad to share that I have joined the department of Physics at University of Oxford as a postdoctural researcher. In the future I will work on a EU project Zero-Emission Buildings enhanced by Artificial Intelligence. 

In the meantime, together with Prof. Sonia Contera, we will look into bio-inspired metamaterials for hierarchical design of novel construction materials. Leveraging the efficient metastructrues inspired by nature, we aim to develop a hierarchical design method for tougher and greener construction materials, enanbled by generative machine learning. We also look into the effects of novel functional materials such as nanotubes, which may help us develop self-sensing materials for longterm structural health monitoring. 

I look forward to the future research journey and more talks and collaborations with researchers in this field.

abstract: The influence of the microstructure on the visco-elastic properties of concrete
  is investigated using finite element simulations at the meso-scale. We first derive
  a constitutive law for the creep of the cement paste which accounts for both recoverable
  and permanent deformations, as well as the influence of temperature and internal
  relative humidity. The model is calibrated on a set of experiments at the cement
  paste scale, and then validated after upscaling to the concrete scale. The model
  is then applied to study the influence of the microstructure on the macroscopic
  creep of concrete. We show that materials with finer particles exhibit less creep,
  and that the anisotropy of creep can be explained with the shape and orientation
  of the aggregates. Furthermore, the acceleration of the stress relaxation in the
  presence of damage is explained by the micro-mechanical interaction between the
  aggregates, the cement paste, and the micro-cracks.

abstract: This paper describes an experimental investigation into the relationship
  between the splitting tensile strength and compressive strength of glass fiber reinforced
  concrete (GFRC) and polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC). The splitting
  tensile strength and compressive strength of GFRC and PFRC at 7, 28 and 90 days
  are used. Test results indicate that the addition of glass and polypropylene fibers
  to concrete increased the splitting tensile strength of concrete by approximately
  20-50%, and the splitting tensile strength of GFRC and PFRC ranged from 9% to 13%
  of its compressive strength. Based on this investigation, a simple 0.5 power relationship
  between the splitting tensile strength and the compressive strength was derived
  for estimating the tensile strength of GFRC and PFRC. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

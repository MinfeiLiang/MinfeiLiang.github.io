abstract: In this experimental and analytic research, the strength development for
  various curing histories was investigated with particular regard to the influences
  of curing time points with given temperatures. For this purpose, four different
  points of curing time were considered with an individual interval of 24 h. Two different
  temperatures of 5°C and 40°C were applied for the selective intervals, whereas the
  rest period days were under the reference curing condition of 20°C. A new model
  for the strength prediction was suggested based on the rate constant model. In this
  model, the equivalent ages introduced in the Saul and Arrhenius models were modified
  to show the effects of curing temperature at different ages. Test results show that
  the concrete subjected to a high temperature at an early age attains higher early-age
  strength but eventually attains lower later-age strength. The concrete subjected
  to a low temperature at an early age leads to lower early-age strength but al most
  the same later-age strength. Moreover, the proposed model showed better agreement
  with the test results than the existing models. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

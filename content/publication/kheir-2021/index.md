abstract: Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) exhibits high autogenous shrinkage
  (AS) which significantly increases the risk of early age cracking. To predict the
  risks of early age shrinkage cracking of environmentally friendly CEM III-based
  UHPC, a numerical model originally developed for early age crack assessment of ordinary
  concrete, has been further developed and applied on a demonstration wall with high
  risk of cracking, cast on a non-deforming slab. The design of the wall was determined
  through numerical simulation using different parameters, resulting from specific
  experiments performed on the desired concrete mixture. Early age crack assessment
  parameters for the model were obtained through different tests performed using the
  Temperature-Stress Testing Machine (TSTM). Finally, this UHPC wall was built, and
  occurring strain deformations were recorded in real time using fiber optic (SOFO)
  sensors embedded in the wall, and measurements taken from demountable mechanical
  strain gauges (DEMEC). Restrained shrinkage measurements were obtained for the same
  mixture through ring tests. A comparison between the numerical simulation results
  and the measurements proved that the proposed model is suitable for UHPC, and the
  model predicts well the time of crack appearance. Finally, it has been shown that
  shrinkage values along the wall height are influenced by the degree of restraint.

abstract: <p>Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement can be used as an alternative binder
  in concrete, partially or fully replacing ordinary Portland cement. While CSA cement
  considerably accelerates the mechanical properties development, the rapid evolution
  of the microstructure together with the high water demand cause rapid and large
  volume changes at early ages. As volume changes may lead to early-age cracking,
  measures to reduce them may be required In this paper, autogenous and drying shrinkage
  are studied in mortars prepared with Portland cement, CSA cement or a 50/50 blend
  as binder. Very fast self-desiccation and high autogenous shrinkage of the CSA-based
  mortar were observed compared to the mortar made with Portland cement. On the other
  hand, the early-age volume changes can be limited if a blend of the two cements
  is used. The blended system revealed a bi-modal trend in the evolution of self-desiccation
  and autogenous shrinkage, in which the initial fast self-desiccation and shrinkage
  enter the dormant phase after the first couple of days and again start after about
  28Â days.</p>

abstract: This paper describes the underlying principles behind the evolution in performance
  of ternary composite cements comprising Portland cement clinker, slag and limestone.
  By using the predicted phase assemblage as an input for the micromechanical model,
  the mechanisms underlying the evolution of mortar strength and Young's modulus were
  analyzed and quantified. This allowed the roles of hydrate assemblages and porosity
  distribution on the evolution of performance to be explained and quantified. Slag
  hydration results in the formation of a microstructure more efficient for development
  of compressive strength and elastic stiffness. Limestone further improves microstructure
  and enhances reactivity of the systems studied.

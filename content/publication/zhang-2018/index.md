abstract: 'Cement paste possesses complex microstructural features including defects/pores
  over a range of length-scales, from nanometres to millimetres in size. As a consequence,
  it exhibits different behaviour under loading depending on the size. In this work,
  cubic specimens in a size range of 1: 400 were produced and tested by a one-sided
  splitting concept using different testing instruments. The smallest specimen with
  size of 100 μm showed a high nominal splitting strength (18.81 MPa), an order of
  magnitude higher than the measured strength of 40 mm specimen (1.8 MPa). The test
  results were used to fit existing analytical size effect models. Although a good
  fit can be found for the existing size effect models, special attention should be
  given to the physical meaning behind these empirical parameters. In addition, a
  multi-scale modelling strategy that considers microstructural features at different
  length scales was adopted to model the trend of decreasing strength with specimen
  size observed in experiments. A good agreement between experimental observations
  and modelling results indicates that the featured material structure dominates the
  observed size effect on measured strength in the size range considered.'

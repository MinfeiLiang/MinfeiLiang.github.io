abstract: Appropriate utilization of wasted coral aggregates on reefs or islands that
  are far from the mainland would substantially reduce construction costs and shorten
  the construction period of offshore projects, but the application of coral aggregate
  concrete (CAC) in island construction is limited due to the low strength and poor
  anti-permeability resistance of the coral aggregates. In this paper, eco-friendly
  slag-based alkali-activated materials (AAMs) were considered as alternatives to
  ordinary Portland cement (OPC) to improve the weak characteristics of the coral
  aggregates. The whole stress-strain curves, axial compressive strength (fc), elastic
  modulus (Ec), and Poisson's ratio (Ï…c) of alkali-activated seawater coral aggregate
  concrete (AACAC) with different alkaline contents (Na2O-to-binder ratio of 3%, 4%,
  and 6% by mass) were investigated under uniaxial compression, and a scanning electron
  microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the interfacial microstructures between
  the paste matrix and the aggregates. The experimental results demonstrated that
  the failure patterns of CAC and AACAC under uniaxial compression were similar and
  were characterized by the coral aggregates being completely crushed. Additionally,
  the AACAC had a wider interfacial transition zone (ITZ), contained a higher Ec (approximately
  9.9% improvement), and exhibited better ductility under the same concrete compressive
  strength (fcu) than the cement-based CAC. Finally, the constitutive relationship
  of stress-strain curves and an empirical model between Ec and fcu of AACAC were
  established based on the existing model.

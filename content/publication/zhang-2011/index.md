abstract: Arresting of cement hydration, followed by drying, is necessary to prepare
  samples for many techniques of microstructural analysis. This paper reviews the
  effects on microstructure and composition of cement paste caused by the most common
  drying techniques, including direct drying (oven, microwave, D-drying, P-drying,
  and freeze drying) and solvent exchange methods. Supercritical drying is proposed
  as a method that could effectively preserve the cement microstructure, but which
  has not been applied to cementitious materials. Experiments are reported that systematically
  quantify the effects of drying from several solvents, freeze drying, and direct
  drying of young paste. Freeze drying is an effective drying method to prepare samples
  for chemical analysis, but it might change the microstructure. Isopropanol exchange
  followed by ambient drying is the best known method for preserving the microstructure
  with minimal effect on the composition of cement. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

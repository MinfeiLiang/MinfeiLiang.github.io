abstract: The elastic modulus of OPC cement pastes before and after carbonation was
  tested by nanoindentation technique. The test results show that carbonation reaction
  causes significant reduction of the frequencies of elastic modulus in the 7∼34GPa
  and 83∼160GPa, meanwhile a dramatic increase of the frequency of elastic modulus
  in the 34∼83GPa. Both portlandite, C-S-H gel and unhydrated cement particles are
  susceptible to carbonation. The elastic modulus frequency value of LD C-S-H and
  HD C-S-H after carbonation decreases by 85.4% and 55.5%, respectively. LD C-S-H
  is more heavily affected by the carbonation degradation compared to HD C-S-H. Before
  carbonation reaction, the size of unhydrated cement particles is about 15∼30um,
  and the hydrated products wrap around the unhydrated cement particles and the elastic
  modulus decreases progressively outward from the center of cement particles. After
  carbonation reaction, the number and size of unhydrated cement particles decreased
  obviously.

abstract: "This study is focused on the behaviour of concrete at early-age in massive
  structures, in relation with the prediction of both cracking risk and residual stresses,
  which is still a challenging task. In this paper, a 3D thermo-chemo-mechanical model
  has been developed, on the basis of complete material characterization experiments,
  in order to predict the early-age development of strains and residual stresses,
  and in order to assess the risk of cracking in massive concrete structures. The
  parameters of the proposed model were identified on two different concretes, High
  Performance Concrete and Fibrous Self-Compacted Concrete - from simple experiments
  in the laboratory: uniaxial tension and compression tests, dynamic Young's modulus
  measurements, free and autogenous shrinkages, semi-adiabatic calorimetry. The proposed
  model has been implemented in a Finite Element code, and the numerical simulations
  of the laboratory tests have proved the model consistency. Furthermore, early-age
  experiments conducted on massive structures have also been simulated, in order to
  investigate the predictive capability of the model, and to assess the model performance
  in practical situations where varying temperatures are involved. Â© 2010 Elsevier

abstract: The creep properties of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) are assessed by
  means of nanoindentation creep experiments on a wide range of substoichiometric
  cement pastes. We observe that, after a few seconds, the measured creep compliance
  of C-S-H is very well captured by a logarithmic time function. The rate of the logarithmic
  creep is found to scale in a unique manner with indentation modulus, indentation
  hardness, and packing density, independent of processing, mix proportions, indenter
  geometry and load history. The comparison with macroscopic creep experiments on
  concrete shows that minutes-long nanoindentations enable a quantitative assessment
  of the long-term creep properties of cementitious materials, orders of magnitude
  faster than macroscopic testing. Finally, we show that a strong analogy exists between
  this logarithmic creep behavior of C-S-H and that of soils, which suggests a granular
  origin of creep of geomaterials. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

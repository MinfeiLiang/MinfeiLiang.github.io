abstract: The effect of high volumes of two supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs)
  (fly ash and slag) on the mechanical performance of self-consolidating concrete
  (SCC) was investigated. Binary and ternary mixes were prepared replacing 60-90%
  of the Portland cement in the control mix (cement = 415.1 kg/m 3). Mix designs were
  selected such that a wide range of CaO/(SiO 2 + Al 2O 3) was achieved. Results show
  that SCC containing high volumes of SCMs have similar engineering properties (compressive
  strength, elastic modulus, creep, shrinkage) as conventional SCC at later ages (≥28
  day). A novel efficiency expression was developed to predict compressive strength.

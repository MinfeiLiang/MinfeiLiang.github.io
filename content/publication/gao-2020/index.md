abstract: To assess the effect of relative humidity (RH) on drying-induced damage
  in concrete, the non-uniform strains and microcracks in concrete under different
  RH conditions were obtained using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique
  and lattice fracture model. The simulated non-uniform displacements were consistent
  with those captured using DIC. A new damage index was proposed by considering all
  the subsets with equivalent strain larger than the threshold tensile strength. The
  calculated damage index showed good correlation with the microcracks' total area
  and indicated that RH equal or lower than 55% could cause relatively high cracking
  risk. This work provides an attractive method for quantifying drying-induced damage
  in concrete using the DIC technique.

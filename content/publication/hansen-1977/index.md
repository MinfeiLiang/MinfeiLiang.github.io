abstract: When teaching students across the humanities, the practical arts and the
  social sciences, and from many different countries, we are still sometimes asked,
  ‘what is cultural studies?’ In this chapter we respond afresh to this curiosity,
  by introducing cultural studies as a particular approach within a wider field of
  the study of culture.

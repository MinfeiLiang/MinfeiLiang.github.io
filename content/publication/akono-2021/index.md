abstract: We investigate the basic creep and fracture response of fine recycled aggregate
  concrete using nanoscale mechanical characterization modules integrated with nonlinear
  micromechanical modeling and machine learning methods. Fine recycled concrete aggregate
  mortar exhibits a larger volume fraction of micropores and low-density calcium silicate
  hydrates compared to natural sand mortar. In return, natural sand mortar exhibits
  a larger volume fraction of hard aggregates. The macroscopic logarithmic creep modulus
  for fine recycled concrete aggregate mortar is five times lower than that of natural
  sand mortar. Finally, the fracture toughness of fine recycled aggregate concrete
  is 8% lower than that of plain concrete.

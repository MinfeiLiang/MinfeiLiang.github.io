 abstract = {We investigate the basic creep and fracture response of fine recycled aggregate concrete using nanoscale mechanical characterization modules integrated with nonlinear micromechanical modeling and machine learning methods. Fine recycled concrete aggregate mortar exhibits a larger volume fraction of micropores and low-density calcium silicate hydrates compared to natural sand mortar. In return, natural sand mortar exhibits a larger volume fraction of hard aggregates. The macroscopic logarithmic creep modulus for fine recycled concrete aggregate mortar is five times lower than that of natural sand mortar. Finally, the fracture toughness of fine recycled aggregate concrete is 8% lower than that of plain concrete.},

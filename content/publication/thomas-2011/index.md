abstract: Efforts to model and simulate the highly complex cement hydration process
  over the past 40 years are reviewed, covering different modeling approaches such
  as single particle models, mathematical nucleation and growth models, and vector
  and lattice-based approaches to simulating microstructure development. Particular
  attention is given to promising developments that have taken place in the past few
  years. Recent applications of molecular-scale simulation methods to understanding
  the structure and formation of calcium-silicate-hydrate phases, and to understanding
  the process of dissolution of cement minerals in water are also discussed, as these
  topics are highly relevant to the future development of more complete and fundamental
  hydration models. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

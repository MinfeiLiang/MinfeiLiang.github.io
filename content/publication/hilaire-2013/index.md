abstract: "At early age, massive structures are prone to thermal cracking and may
  be damaged by the restraint of the thermal strain. Thermal and mechanical analysis
  have to be relevant to perform reliable numerical simulations. However, some uncertainties
  still remains: for instance, the values of the creep's compliance differed in the
  literature. Creep strains modeling is performed by a rheological model, the evolution
  of hydration, the long term viscoelasticity and the asymmetry of the behavior between
  tension and compression are taken into account. The influence of this dissymmetry
  is assessed throughout the casting of a massive wall on a raft foundation. The results
  show that the final damage field is highly dependent on the value of this dissymetry."

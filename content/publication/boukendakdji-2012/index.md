abstract: 'This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried
  out to study the effect of granulated blast furnace slag and two types of superplasticizers
  on the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC). In control SCC, cement was
  replaced with 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% of blast furnace slag. Two types of superplasticizers:
  polycarboxylate based superplasticizer and naphthalene sulphonate based superplasticizers
  were used. Tests were conducted for slump flow, the modified slump test, V-Funnel,
  J-Ring, U-Box, and compressive strength. The results showed that polycarboxylate
  based superplasticizer concrete mixes give more workability and higher compressive
  strength, at all ages, than those with naphthalene sulphonate based superplasticizer.
  Inclusion of blast furnace slag by substitution to cement was found to be very beneficial
  to fresh self-compacting concrete. An improvement of workability was observed up
  to 20% of slag content with an optimum content of 15%. Workability retention of
  about 45 min with 15% and 20% of slag content was obtained using a polycarboxylate
  based superplasticizer; compressive strength decreased with the increase in slag
  content, as occurs for vibrated concrete, although at later ages the differences
  were small. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'

abstract: Crack detection is a critical task in monitoring and inspection of civil
  engineering structures. Image classification and bounding box approaches have been
  proposed in existing vision-based automated concrete crack detection methods using
  deep convolutional neural networks. The current study proposes a crack detection
  method based on deep fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation
  on concrete crack images. Performance of three different pre-trained network architectures,
  which serves as the FCN encoder's backbone, is evaluated for image classification
  on a public concrete crack dataset of 40,000 227 × 227 pixel images. Subsequently,
  the whole encoder-decoder FCN network with the VGG16-based encoder is trained end-to-end
  on a subset of 500 annotated 227 × 227-pixel crack-labeled images for semantic segmentation.
  The FCN network achieves about 90% in average precision. Images extracted from a
  video of a cyclic loading test on a concrete specimen are used to validate the proposed
  method for concrete crack detection. It was found that cracks are reasonably detected
  and crack density is also accurately evaluated.

abstract: Steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) has a performance superior to that
  of normal concrete because of the addition of discontinuous fibers. The development
  of strengths prediction technique of SFRC is, however, still in its infancy compared
  to that of normal concrete because of its complexity and limited available data.
  To overcome this limitation, research was conducted to develop an optimum machine
  learning algorithm for predicting the compressive and flexural strengths of SFRC.
  The resulting feature impact was also analyzed to confirm the reliability of the
  models. To achieve this, compressive and flexural strengths data from SFRC were
  collected through extensive literature reviews, and a database was created. Eleven
  machine learning algorithms were then established based on the dataset. K-fold validation
  was conducted to prevent overfitting, and the algorithms were regulated. The boosting-
  and tree-based models had the optimal performance, whereas the K-nearest neighbor,
  linear, ridge, lasso regressor, support vector regressor, and multilayer perceptron
  models had the worst performance. The water-to-cement ratio and silica fume content
  were the most influential factors in the prediction of compressive strength of SFRC,
  whereas the silica fume and fiber volume fraction most strongly influenced the flexural
  strength. Finally, it was found that, in general, the compressive strength prediction
  performance was better than the flexural strength prediction performance, regardless
  of the machine learning algorithm.

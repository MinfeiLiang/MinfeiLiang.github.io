abstract: An approach combining numerical simulations and experimental techniques
  is proposed to investigate the early-age properties of non-reinforced concrete.
  Both thermo-mechanical and fracture behaviors are studied, providing a deep insight
  into the hydration process. This work makes an important step in understanding the
  effects of hydration on the performance of cement-based materials. More specifically,
  in the first part, the shrinkage and fracture properties of a non-reinforced concrete
  have been experimentally considered, along with the characterization of several
  material parameters. The experimental results exhibit a high risk of early-age cracking
  for this kind of concrete. Especially, the fracture phenomena are complex, including
  multi-evolution-stages, initiation, propagation, stop-growing, and re-growing. In
  the second part, the computational modeling based on the phase field method of failure
  mechanism is applied to simulate the thermal, mechanical and fracture behavior due
  to early-age hydration. A detailed discussion on the identification of model/material
  parameters and the construction of numerical model including the boundary conditions
  is given. We provide the following comparison between predictions of the numerical
  simulation with the experimental observations. An excellent predictive capability
  of the computational model is noted. More importantly, this work demonstrates the
  performance of the proposed approach, which requires only a few tests to identify
  the model inputs. Most of the chemo-thermal parameters can be theoretically determined
  based on the concrete mix and the chemical/mineral compositions of the cement.

abstract: This paper deals with autogenous deformation and autogenous relative humidity
  change (RH change) in hardening cement paste. Theoretical considerations and experimental
  data are presented, which elucidate the influence of temperature on these properties.
  This is an important subject in the control of early age cracking of concrete. It
  is demonstrated that the traditional maturity concept generally is not applicable
  to autogenous deformation and autogenous RH change.

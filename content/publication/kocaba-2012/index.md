abstract: To measure the degree of reaction of slag in blended pastes, five methods
  were studied. Selective dissolution and differential scanning calorimetry are shown
  to be unreliable, SEM-BSE-IA-mapping is time consuming, but does provide good results
  with a reasonable degree of precision. The difference in cumulative calorimetry
  and chemical shrinkage curves of slag blends in comparison to blends with inert
  filler shows potential to isolate the reaction of the slag. These methods have the
  advantage of being continuous, techniques with good precision, but the absolute
  heat of hydration, or contribution to chemical shrinkage of any particular slag
  is not known. Calibration of the calorimetry technique with SEM-BSE-IA-mapping seems
  to be a promising method to understand and quantify the degree of reaction of slag.

abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried
  out to study the influence of industrial slag on the rheological, self-compactability
  and strength properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) incorporating high volume
  replacements of industrial slag up to 90%. The rheological properties such as plastic
  viscosity and yield stress were evaluated using ICAR rheometer. The effect of high
  range water reducing admixture (HRWR) dosage, and the self-compactability properties
  such as T50, slump flow, V-funnel flow times and L-box blocking ratio were also
  investigated. The results illustrated that plastic viscosity decreased with the
  increase of the percentage of slag and the yield stress was nearly zero for all
  the replacements studied. The compressive strengths determined for the SCCs demonstrated
  that high strength SCC of more than 100 MPa at 30% and low strength SCC of 20 MPa
  at 90% replacement can be realized by utilizing slag appropriately.

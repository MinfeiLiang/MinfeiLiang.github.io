 abstract = {This paper focused on the evolution over time of elasticity of the cement paste during the hydration, e g, Young's modulus and Poisson's ration, by the proposed homogenization method combined the percolation algorithm with individual phase intrinsic elasticity. A cement paste development model, named CEMHYD3D, was used to establish an accurate microstructure. The modelling results are in good agreement with the experimental data and other numerical results available in the open literature. The suitable homogeneous scheme, applied to each level, should be carefully chosen to result in a realistic prediction. The percolation concept should aims to correctly predict the elasticity for cement paste at very early age, especially under low w/c ratios.

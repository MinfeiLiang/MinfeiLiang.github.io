abstract: This paper focused on the evolution over time of elasticity of the cement
  paste during the hydration, e g, Young's modulus and Poisson's ration, by the proposed
  homogenization method combined the percolation algorithm with individual phase intrinsic
  elasticity. A cement paste development model, named CEMHYD3D, was used to establish
  an accurate microstructure. The modelling results are in good agreement with the
  experimental data and other numerical results available in the open literature.
  The suitable homogeneous scheme, applied to each level, should be carefully chosen
  to result in a realistic prediction. The percolation concept should aims to correctly
  predict the elasticity for cement paste at very early age, especially under low
  w/c ratios. Â© 2013 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

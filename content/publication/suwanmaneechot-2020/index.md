abstract: The mechanism behind the creep of concrete is primarily governed by calcium
  silicate hydrate (C-S-H). The results presented in this study demonstrate the effect
  of varying relative humidity, water-to-cement ratios, and cement type on the creep
  properties of hardened cement paste as determined by microindentation. Water vapor
  sorption and XRD/Rietveld analysis were used to characterize the tested cement paste
  samples. Multi-scale analysis was also applied to downscale the creep properties
  of the cement paste to that of the C-S-H gel. When the drying relative humidity
  decreased, the specific surface area decreased whereas the bulk modulus of the C-S-H
  gel increased. This increase of creep modulus may be explained by the sliding of
  C-S-H sheets as lubricated by water molecules. Drying reduces the specific surface
  area, resulting in increased difficulty in the sliding of C-S-H sheets; hence, the
  creep modulus increases.

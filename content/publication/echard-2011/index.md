abstract: An important challenge in structural reliability is to keep to a minimum
  the number of calls to the numerical models. Engineering problems involve more and
  more complex computer codes and the evaluation of the probability of failure may
  require very time-consuming computations. Metamodels are used to reduce these computation
  times. To assess reliability, the most popular approach remains the numerous variants
  of response surfaces. Polynomial Chaos [1] and Support Vector Machine [2] are also
  possibilities and have gained considerations among researchers in the last decades.
  However, recently, Kriging, originated from geostatistics, have emerged in reliability
  analysis. Widespread in optimisation, Kriging has just started to appear in uncertainty
  propagation [3] and reliability [4,5] studies. It presents interesting characteristics
  such as exact interpolation and a local index of uncertainty on the prediction which
  can be used in active learning methods. The aim of this paper is to propose an iterative
  approach based on Monte Carlo Simulation and Kriging metamodel to assess the reliability
  of structures in a more efficient way. The method is called AK-MCS for Active learning
  reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation. It is shown to
  be very efficient as the probability of failure obtained with AK-MCS is very accurate
  and this, for only a small number of calls to the performance function. Several
  examples from literature are performed to illustrate the methodology and to prove
  its efficiency particularly for problems dealing with high non-linearity, non-differentiability,
  non-convex and non-connex domains of failure and high dimensionality. Â© 2011 Elsevier

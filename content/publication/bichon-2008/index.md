abstract: Many engineering applications are characterized by implicit response functions
  that are expensive to evaluate and sometimes nonlinear in their behavior, making
  reliability analysis difficult. This paper develops an efficient reliability analysis
  method that accurately characterizes the limit state throughout the random variable
  space. The method begins with a Gaussian process model built from a very small number
  of samples, and then adaptively chooses where to generate subsequent samples to
  ensure that the model is accurate in the vicinity of the limit state. The resulting
  Gaussian process model is then sampled using multimodal adaptive importance sampling
  to calculate the probability of exceeding (or failing to exceed) the response level
  of interest. By locating multiple points on or near the limit state, more complex
  and nonlinear limit states can be modeled, leading to more accurate probability
  integration. By concentrating the samples in the area where accuracy is important
  (i.e., in the vicinity of the limit state), only a small number of true function
  evaluations are required to build a quality surrogate model. The resulting method
  is both accurate for any arbitrarily shaped limit state and computationally efficient
  even for expensive response functions. This new method is applied to a collection
  of example problems including one that analyzes the reliability of a microelectromechanical
  system device that current available methods have difficulty solving either accurately
  or efficiently. Copyright Â© 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,

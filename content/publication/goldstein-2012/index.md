  Abstract. Unsupervised anomaly detection is the process of nding outliers in data
  sets without prior training. In this paper, a histogram-based outlier detection
  (HBOS) algorithm is presented, which scores records in linear time. It assumes independence
  of the features making it much faster than multivariate approaches at the cost of
  less precision. A comparative evaluation on three UCI data sets and 10 standard
  algorithms show, that it can detect global outliers as reliable as state-of-the-art
  algorithms, but it performs poor on local outlier problems. HBOS is in our experiments
  up to 5 times faster than clustering based algorithms and up to 7 times faster than
  nearest-neighbor based methods.'

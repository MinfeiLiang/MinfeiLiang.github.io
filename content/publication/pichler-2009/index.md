abstract: 'In this paper, homogenization schemes for upscaling of elastic properties
  in the framework of continuum micromechanics are extended towards upscaling of viscoelastic
  material properties. Hereby, the Laplace-Carson transform method is applied to the
  Mori-Tanaka scheme, the self-consistent scheme, and the generalized self-consistent
  scheme and solved numerically by the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm. The performance of
  the so-obtained upscaling schemes is: (i) illustrated for an academic example (a
  2-phase composite with Maxwellian-type creep response of the phases) and (ii) assessed
  considering a polyester matrix/marble dust filler composite with respective experimental
  data taken from the literature. Hereby, for the investigated range of volume fractions
  of inclusions, ranging from 29 vol.% to 55 vol.%, and a matrix/inclusion-type morphology,
  the transformed generalized self-consistent scheme emerged as the most suitable
  scheme for determination of the effective viscoelastic properties of this highly-filled
  composite material, resulting in a sound representation of the experimental data.

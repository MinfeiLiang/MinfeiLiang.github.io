 abstract = {In this paper, homogenization schemes for upscaling of elastic properties in the framework of continuum micromechanics are extended towards upscaling of viscoelastic material properties. Hereby, the Laplace-Carson transform method is applied to the Mori-Tanaka scheme, the self-consistent scheme, and the generalized self-consistent scheme and solved numerically by the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm. The performance of the so-obtained upscaling schemes is: (i) illustrated for an academic example (a 2-phase composite with Maxwellian-type creep response of the phases) and (ii) assessed considering a polyester matrix/marble dust filler composite with respective experimental data taken from the literature. Hereby, for the investigated range of volume fractions of inclusions, ranging from 29 vol.% to 55 vol.%, and a matrix/inclusion-type morphology, the transformed generalized self-consistent scheme emerged as the most suitable scheme for determination of the effective viscoelastic properties of this highly-filled composite material, resulting in a sound representation of the experimental data. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

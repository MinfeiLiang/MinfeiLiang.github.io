abstract: Autogenous shrinkage is a major concern in early age cracking of high performance
  concrete (HPC). Low water-to-binder ratio and incorporation of supplementary cementitious
  materials (SCMs) can remarkably affect the pore structure, relative humidity, self-stress,
  degree of hydration, and interface structure; hence, increase the shrinkage in the
  matrix. In this paper, the mechanism of autogenous shrinkage of HPC and influential
  factors in its development are discussed. In general, autogenous shrinkage is more
  pronounced in HPC, albeit, using low heat cement, fly ash, shrinkage reducing agents,
  lightweight aggregates, and fibers can effectively reduce it. The effects of SCMs
  on autogenous shrinkage, relationship between different types of shrinkage and autogenous
  shrinkage as well as the effect of internal curing on autogenous shrinkage need
  to be further studied.

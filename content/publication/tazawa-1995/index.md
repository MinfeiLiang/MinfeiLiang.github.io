abstract: It has recently been proved that autogenous shrinkage is considerably large
  for highstrength concrete. In this study influences of cement, chemical admixture,
  mineral admixture and water-cement ratio on autogenous shrinkage of cement paste
  were experimentally studied. It was proved that autogenous shrinkage could be estimated
  form mineral composition of cement. Some admixtures which were able to reduce autogenous
  shrinkage were found. Â© 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.

abstract: Proper functioning and safety of anchor elements are decisive for the overall
  performance of a structural system. A possible failure mode for anchor loaded in
  shear is the concrete breakout failure. Concrete related failure mode poses a significant
  safety issue, since they may develop abruptly/brittle, without preceding signs of
  damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of the concrete breakout strength of anchors
  in shear is crucial. This study proposes two machine learning models — a Gaussian
  process regression (GPR) and a support vector machine (SVM) model — for predicting
  the concrete breakout capacity of single anchors in shear. To this end, experimental
  strength of 366 tests on single anchors with concrete edge breakout failures were
  collected from literature to establish the experimental database to train and test
  the models. 70% of the data were used for the model training, and the rest were
  used for the model testing. Shear influence factors such as the concrete strength,
  the anchor diameter, the embedment depth (technically the influence length), and
  the concrete edge distance were taken as the model input variables. The generated
  GPR and SVM prediction models yielded a determination coefficient R2 = 0.99 for
  both the training and testing data sets. Predictions from the developed models were
  compared to that of the other existing models (Eurocode 2, ACI 318 and Grosser)
  to validate their performance. The developed GPR and SVM models provided a better
  prediction of the experimentally observed shear strength, compared to the existing
  models. The predictions obtained from the GPR model are the most accurate, yielding
  a value of 5.6 mean absolute error when tested.

abstract: Packed bed chromatography is commonly applied for the separation of large
  molecules in biopharmaceutical industry. A technical chromatography system is typically
  composed of a cylindrical column that is filled with porous spheres. Particularly
  in small columns, which are increasingly applied for parallel experiments on lab
  robotic platforms, the impacts of inhomogeneous packing and wall effects on separation
  performance can be quite significant. We hence study mass transfer by convection,
  diffusion and adsorption in three-dimensional sphere packings. Random packings are
  externally generated and imported into COMSOL where the model equations are easy
  to implement. However, the COMSOL functions for automatic meshing and for iteratively
  solving the resulting equation systems fail to work with default settings. We have
  previously established a semi-automated and half-manual meshing procedure for rather
  small packings with less than 150 spheres that works with the direct PARDISO solver.
  The present contribution addresses the evaluation and optimization of the iterative
  equation solvers that are provided by COMSOL for the given spatial geometries with
  up to ten million degrees of freedom. The presented results illustrate that we can
  iteratively solve systems with up to 750 spheres using less memory and less computational
  time. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

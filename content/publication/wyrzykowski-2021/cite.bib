 abstract = {Early-age drying (immediately after casting) of mortars and the corresponding plastic shrinkage were studied using bimodal neutron/X-ray computed tomography. This novel, correlative 3D imaging mode enabled studying simultaneously and without any source of spurious perturbation the water migration and loss processes together with the corresponding deformations due to plastic shrinkage. Bimodal imaging opens up new possibilities for studying dynamic processes of coupled water transport and deformations in porous solids. The measurements were carried out on model systems (cylindrical mortar specimens with height of 19 mm). The study focused on the effect of a paraffin-based curing compound. Our results confirm that when the curing compound was applied directly onto the drying surface in a sufficient amount, both the evaporation rate and the rate of vertical displacement (settlement) were substantially reduced. The results shed a new light on the mechanisms of plastic shrinkage and the action of curing compounds.},

abstract: This paper examines the influence of 2 common South African aggregate types
  on the compressive strength, split and flexural tensile strength and elastic modulus
  properties of high strength concrete. Two different aggregate types (Andesite and
  Granite) were used to produce concrete with target strengths ranging from 30 MPa
  to 120 MPa. Granite concrete was found to have a higher compressive strength, while
  the stiffer Andesite aggregate produced concrete with a significantly higher elastic
  modulus. An attempt is made to explain this phenomenon with fracture mechanic theories.
  No trend was identified for the influence of aggregate type on splitting and flexural
  tensile strength. The effectiveness of the SANS and EN elastic modulus prediction
  models was analysed against the test results and it was found that both prediction
  models accurately predicted elastic modulus values for the Andesite concrete, but
  produced far less accurate predictions for the Granite concrete.

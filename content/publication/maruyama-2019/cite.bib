 abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the early-age properties of concrete, from a materials science and concrete engineering perspective. The aim of this manuscript is to contribute to gap analysis and to improve the strategy for evaluation methods of the risk of cracking in mass concrete. Strength, elastic modulus, and volumetric stability at early ages are discussed.},

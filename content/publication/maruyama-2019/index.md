abstract: This paper provides an overview of the early-age properties of concrete,
  from a materials science and concrete engineering perspective. The aim of this manuscript
  is to contribute to gap analysis and to improve the strategy for evaluation methods
  of the risk of cracking in mass concrete. Strength, elastic modulus, and volumetric
  stability at early ages are discussed.

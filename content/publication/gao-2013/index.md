abstract: In this paper, the ring test is used to determine the stress relaxation
  parameters of concrete in tension at early-age. Through ring test, the steel-concrete
  interfacial compressive stress generated from shrinkage of concrete is obtained
  first. Meanwhile, the theoretical value of the interfacial compressive stress is
  precisely calculated by a model for given shrinkage of concrete. In the model, a
  power function with three unknown constants was used to model the viscoelastic behavior
  of concrete under tension. The expected stress relaxation constants can then be
  determined with the condition that the difference between calculated and tested
  interfacial compressive stresses satisfies the required tolerance. Using this mythology,
  the creep relaxation parameters of three kinds of concretes with compressive strength
  at 28 days around 30 MPa, 50 MPa and 80 MPa are obtained. The determined stress
  relaxation parameters are used in the existing experimental results of shrinkage
  stress tests that are independently carried out and reasonable agreement between
  model and test data is found. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

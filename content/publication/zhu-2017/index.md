abstract: Cracking due to temperature and restraint in mass concrete is an important
  issue. A temperature stress testing machine (TSTM) is an effective test method to
  study the mechanism of temperature cracking. A synchronous closed loop federated
  control TSTM system has been developed by adopting the design concepts of a closed
  loop federated control, a detachable mold design, a direct measuring deformation
  method, and a temperature deformation compensation method. The results show that
  the self-developed system has the comprehensive ability of simulating different
  restraint degrees, multiple temperature and humidity modes, and closed-loop control
  of multi-TSTMs during one test period. Additionally, the direct measuring deformation
  method can obtain a more accurate deformation and restraint degree result with little
  local damage. The external temperature deformation affecting the concrete specimen
  can be eliminated by adopting the temperature deformation compensation method with
  different considerations of steel materials. The concrete quality of different TSTMs
  can be guaranteed by being vibrated on the vibrating stand synchronously. The detachable
  mold design and assembled method has greatly overcome the difficulty of eccentric
  force and deformation.

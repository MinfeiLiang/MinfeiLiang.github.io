abstract: The rapid development in construction industry, induce a large amounts of
  concrete data that are usually measured and analyzed everyday naming that concrete
  is the second usable material on earth. Concrete is made from numerous ingredients
  that have huge variability either at the design stage or at the testing stage. The
  main goal of this paper is to quantify the anomalies and outliers during the design
  phase of concrete mixtures. Concrete mixtures have various percentages of ingredients
  such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, fine and coarse aggregates.
  Machine learning and data mining is considered a very thriving topic in many research
  fields and its implementation in the construction industry still limited. Concrete
  community is in need for such a tool to produce an efficient way to efficiently
  design concrete mixtures. Outliers could occur during the evaluation of samplesâ€™
  measurements that might include human or system errors. The Local Outlier Factor
  (LOF) algorithm is the most common method used to determine outliers, however, the
  LOF has some challenges. In this paper, an anomaly-based outlier detection algorithm
  called Isolation Forest based on a Sliding window for the Local Outlier Factor (IFS-LOF)
  algorithm, is proposed to solve the limitations of the LOF in evaluating 1030 concrete
  mixtures. The proposed algorithm works without any previous knowledge of data distribution
  and executes the process within limited memory and with minimal computational effort.
  The evaluation of results proved that the IFS-LOF algorithm is more efficient in
  detecting the sequence of outliers and provided more efficient accuracy that other
  state of the art LOF algorithms.

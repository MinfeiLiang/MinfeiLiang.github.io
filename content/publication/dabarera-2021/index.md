abstract: Accurate quantification of early-age tensile creep is vital to determine
  the stress build-up and the related crack sensitivity of concrete structures. Performing
  tensile creep testing in concrete is a challenging task and therefore reliable test
  data reported in literature is rather limited. The available test data indicates
  a large scatter and there is no consensus in the scientific community regarding
  early-age basic creep in tension. Besides, most of the prediction models in design
  codes are mainly calibrated using long-term compressive creep test data and their
  capabilities for predicting early-age tensile creep remain questionable. This paper
  first presents a comprehensive set of test data on early-age tensile creep of high-performance
  concrete using two unique methods, namely a Temperature Stress Testing Machine and
  a direct tensile test setup. The reliability of the collected data is demonstrated
  through the good agreement between the test data generated by these two test setups.
  Autogenous shrinkage measurements are performed simultaneously and used for determining
  basic tensile creep profiles. The governing factors affecting tensile creep including
  loading age, strength and temperature are experimentally explored in depth. The
  limitations of the widely utilized basic creep prediction model in the fib Model
  Code 2010 are identified. Based on the newly measured test data, modifications to
  the existing model are proposed. The proposed model better reflects not only the
  data collected in this study, but also that in other published data, thereby highlighting
  the capabilities of this model for accurate assessment of early-age basic tensile
  creep of high-performance concrete.

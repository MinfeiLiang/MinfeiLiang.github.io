abstract: Disposal of slag resulting from pig iron process is one of the main eco-friendly
  confrontations. This confrontation is still increasing with the increase slag content
  and diminishing the landfill space latitude. Accordingly, studies have been achieved
  to reuse granulated ground blast-furnace slag (denoted as slag) by way of high-volume
  (HVS) as a cement replacement in building materials. This article offerings a review
  summary of the earlier investigations which concentrated on using HVS (â‰¥45%) as
  a part of cement in conventional paste, mortar and concrete mixtures. Fresh properties,
  mechanical properties, durability and other properties of paste, mortar and concrete
  mixtures containing HVS as a cement replacement have been reviewed. Furthermore,
  curing conditions as well as different additives used to improve some properties
  of HVS system such as nano particles, cementitious materials, and other materials
  have been summarized.

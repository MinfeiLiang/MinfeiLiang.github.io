abstract: Stress-strain curves are an important representation of a material's mechanical
  properties, from which important properties such as elastic modulus, strength, and
  toughness, are defined. However, generating stress-strain curves from numerical
  methods such as finite element method (FEM) is computationally intensive, especially
  when considering the entire failure path for a material. As a result, it is difficult
  to perform high throughput computational design of materials with large design spaces,
  especially when considering mechanical responses beyond the elastic limit. In this
  work, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and convolutional neural
  networks (CNN) are used to predict the entire stress-strain behavior of binary composites
  evaluated over the entire failure path, motivated by the significantly faster inference
  speed of empirical models. We show that PCA transforms the stress-strain curves
  into an effective latent space by visualizing the eigenbasis of PCA. Despite having
  a dataset of only 10-27% of possible microstructure configurations, the mean absolute
  error of the prediction is <10% of the range of values in the dataset, when measuring
  model performance based on derived material descriptors, such as modulus, strength,
  and toughness. Our study demonstrates the potential to use machine learning to accelerate
  material design, characterization, and optimization.

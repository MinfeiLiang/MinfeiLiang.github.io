abstract: A better understanding of the evolution of cement hydration and of the development
  of microstructural formation of cementitious materials at early age is a very important
  requirement for developing a numerical simulation method. Experimental studies and
  numerical modelling become increasingly significant for understanding the microstructural
  properties during cement hydration. In this study, a multifunctional experiment
  combining ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements and dielectric conductivity measurements
  was performed both on cement paste and on concrete mixtures with water/cement ratio
  0.4, 0.45, and 0.55 and with different amounts of aggregate. The samples were cured
  isothermally at 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. The measurements were conducted up to an age
  of 3 days for the cement paste and 7 days for concrete. The initial setting of cement
  paste was found at the time when a sudden increase in the ultrasonic pulse velocity
  occurred and a notable drop in the electric conductivity was observed. These sudden
  changes were also detected with the cement hydration simulation model HYMOSTRUC,
  in which a percolation threshold of the solid phase corresponded with the initial
  setting time. As expected, the lower water/cement ratio and the higher curing temperature
  exhibited a quick increase in ultrasonic pulse velocity and a remarkable decrease
  in conductivity. At a certain point of hydration, the pulse velocity showed a slow
  increase whereas at the same moment a full connectivity of solid phases was found
  with the simulation model. From this study, the validity of the HYMOSTRUC model
  was proved by comparison with the ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements and dielectric
  measurements. This multifunctional experimental setup also shows the potential for
  monitoring the evolution of cement hydration and the development of microstructure
  in hardening cement-based materials in a non-destructive way.

abstract: This paper presents the experimental results and prediction model for the
  autogenous shrinkage of concrete made with various water-to-cementitious materials
  ratios (w / cm) ranging from 0.27 to 0.42 and granulated blast-furnace slag (BFS)
  in the range of 0% to 50% by mass of the total cementitious materials. Test results
  showed that BFS concrete exhibited greater autogenous shrinkage than ordinary concrete
  with no BFS with the same w / cm, and that the higher the BFS content, the greater
  the autogenous shrinkage. At the same content of BFS, the increasing rate of autogenous
  shrinkage is affected by the w / cm; the lower the w / cm, the smaller the increasing
  rate of autogenous shrinkage. Based on the test results, a prediction model for
  autogenous shrinkage was proposed. In particular, an effective autogenous shrinkage
  that is a realistic shrinkage strain responsible for stress development was introduced
  in the model. It was determined by taking into account the characteristics of ultrasonic
  pulse velocity evolution in concrete. This prediction method for autogenous shrinkage
  may be effectively used to estimate the stress induced by autogenous shrinkage.

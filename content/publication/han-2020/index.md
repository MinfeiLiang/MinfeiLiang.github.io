abstract: This paper presents an ensemble machine learning (ML) model for prediction
  of modulus of elasticity (MOE) of concrete formulated using recycled concrete aggregate
  (RCA), in relation to features of its mixture design (e.g., physiochemical characteristics
  of RCA). The ensemble ML model's prediction performance was compared with five commonly-used
  ML models. It is shown that the ensemble ML model unfailingly produces more accurate
  predictions compared to standalone models. To demonstrate the ability of the ensemble
  ML model to go beyond MOE predictions, the model was used to develop optimal mixture
  designs for RCA concretes that satisfy imposed target MOE.

abstract: These recommendations have been prepared by the corresponding working group
  within RILEM TC 287-CCS “Early-age and long-term crack width analysis in RC structures”,
  following work by the previously ceased RILEM TC 254-CMS “Thermal cracking of massive
  concrete structures”. This recommendations document is developed in complementarity
  to the state-of-the-art report of RILEM TC 254-CMS and aims to provide expert advice
  and suggestions to engineers and scientists interested in modelling the thermo-chemo-mechanical
  behaviour of massive concrete structures since concrete casting. Recommendations
  regarding geometrical characteristics and complexities, concrete properties and
  appropriate material models, boundary conditions and loads, and numerical model
  peculiarities with relevance to the simulation of the thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviour
  of massive concrete structures are given herein. The recommendations have been reviewed
  and approved by all members of the TC 287-CCS.

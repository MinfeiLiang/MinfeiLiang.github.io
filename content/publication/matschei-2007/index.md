abstract: 'The AFm phase of Portland cements refers to a family of hydrated calcium
  aluminates based on the hydrocalumite-like structure of 4CaO·Al2O3·13-19 H2O. However
  OH- may be replaced by SO42- and CO32-. Except for limited replacement (50 mol%,
  maximum) of sulfate by hydroxide, these compositions do not form solid solutions
  and, from the mineralogical standpoint, behave as separate phases. Therefore many
  hydrated cements will contain mixtures of AFm phases. AFm phases have been made
  from precursors and experimentally-determined phase relationships are depicted at
  25 °C. Solubility data are reported and thermodynamic data are derived. The 25 °C
  stability of AFm phases is much affected by the nature of the anion: carbonate stabilises
  AFm and displaces OH and SO4 at species activities commonly encountered in cement
  systems. However in the presence of portlandite, and as carbonate displaces sulfate
  in AFm, the reaction results in changes in the amount of both portlandite and ettringite:
  specimen calculations are presented to quantify these changes. The scheme of phase
  balances enables calculation of the mineralogical balances of a hydrated cement
  paste with greater accuracy than hitherto practicable. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

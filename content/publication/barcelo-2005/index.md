abstract: 'According to physical analyses, the driving force of autogenous shrinkage
  of concrete is the change in the capillary pressure induced by self-desiccation
  in its cement matrix. Self-desiccation is caused by the balance between the absolute
  volume reduction (chemical shrinkage) and the building up of the capillary network.
  The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of the cement characteristics
  on the chain of mechanisms leading from hydration to autogenous deformations. Four
  parameters were selected: (i) for clinker, the amount of C3A and free lime and the
  SO3/K2O ratio; (ii) for cement, the fineness. To master the experimental area, 16
  cements were prepared at the laboratory from pure raw materials. An important number
  of characterizing techniques were used in the experimental study. Their choice was
  based on the important parameters drawn from the physical analysis: setting time,
  suspension-solid transition, hydration kinetics through isothermal calorimetry and
  nonevaporable water, chemical shrinkage, evolution of relative humidity, capillary
  porosity and autogenous shrinkage. Using different techniques allowed to determine
  the precise mechanism of action of each parameter. Results showed that these mechanisms
  are generally different, even if their macroscopic consequences may be identical.
  This point will probably be useful for modeling and determining the industrial keys
  reducing the autogenous shrinkage. The physical mechanisms involved in autogenous
  deformations were further understood. In particular, this study shows that initial
  autogenous shrinkage should be considered as a balance between the self-desiccation
  and an initial swelling phase. The influence of the four parameters considered on
  this last phenomenon were also characterized. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'

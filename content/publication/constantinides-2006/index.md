abstract: Several composites comprise material phases that cannot be recapitulated
  ex situ, including calcium silicate hydrates in cementitous materials, hydroxyapatite
  in bone, and clay agglomerates in geomaterials. This requirement for in situ synthesis
  and characterization of chemically complex phases obviates conventional mechanical
  testing of large specimens representative of these material components. Current
  advances in experimental micro and nanomechanics have afforded new opportunities
  to explore and understand the effect of thermochemical environments on the microstructural
  and mechanical characteristics of naturally occurring material composites. Here,
  we propose a straightforward application of instrumented indentation to extract
  the in situ elastic properties of individual components and to image the connectivity
  among these phases in composites. This approach relies on a large array of nano
  to microscale contact experiments and the statistical analysis of the resulting
  data. Provided that the maximum indentation depth is chosen carefully, this method
  has the potential of extracting elastic properties of the indented phase which are
  minimally affected by the surrounding medium. An estimate of the limiting indentation
  depth is provided by asssuming a layered, thin film geometry. The proposed methodology
  is tested on a \"model\" composite material, a titanium-titanium monoboride (Ti-TiB)
  of various volumetric proportions. The elastic properties, volume fractions, and
  morphological arrangement of the two phases are recovered. These results demonstrate
  the information required for any micromechanical model that would predict composition-based
  mechanical performance of a given composite material. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

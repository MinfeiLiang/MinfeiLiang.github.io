abstract: "This research seeks to optimize the sustainability aspect of a self-consolidating
  concrete (SCC) for structural applications by maximizing supplementary cementitious
  material (SCM) content. Four supplementary cementitious materials were used: two
  fly ash and two slag. Twenty-one mixes were made with 0-100% Portland cement replaced
  with SCMs. Early age compressive strength development of the SCM mixtures was normally
  less than the control (only Portland cement). At higher replacement levels, performance
  varied significantly based on the SCM used. Bolomey and Féret strength equations
  were used to evaluate the SCM's efficiency. Reasonable agreement between binder's
  CaO/(SiO 2 + Al 2O 3) ratio and the efficiency factor was observed. © 2011 Elsevier

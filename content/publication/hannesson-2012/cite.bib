 abstract = {This research seeks to optimize the sustainability aspect of a self-consolidating concrete (SCC) for structural applications by maximizing supplementary cementitious material (SCM) content. Four supplementary cementitious materials were used: two fly ash and two slag. Twenty-one mixes were made with 0-100% Portland cement replaced with SCMs. Early age compressive strength development of the SCM mixtures was normally less than the control (only Portland cement). At higher replacement levels, performance varied significantly based on the SCM used. Bolomey and Féret strength equations were used to evaluate the SCM's efficiency. Reasonable agreement between binder's CaO/(SiO 2 + Al 2O 3) ratio and the efficiency factor was observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract: Common, high and ultra high performance concretes undergo autogenous deformation
  (AD) when hardening. Deformations are often measured in specimens cured in so-called
  autogenous conditions, where fully coupled thermal deformation (TD) and AD are the
  only deformations. Therefore, in autogenous conditions, a decoupling technique must
  be used to separate the contributions of TD and AD. This paper presents a new technique
  using optical fiber sensors in specimens that are cured at varying temperatures
  and in autogenous conditions. Degree of reaction indexes (DRI), sometimes called
  maturity and equivalent time, are employed to separate TD and AD. The paper begins
  with a summary of the application of DRI to decoupling techniques, with particular
  focus on theoretical limits and potential for deformation separation. Current practices
  related to decoupling and modeling of the thermal and autogenous deformation are
  evaluated through comparison with experiments. Results confirm that testing improves
  the accuracy of estimation of values for the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC).
  Moreover, since AD swelling is detected for all tests, models that include the assumption
  that AD is exclusively shrinkage are not appropriate for describing AD at varying
  temperatures. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

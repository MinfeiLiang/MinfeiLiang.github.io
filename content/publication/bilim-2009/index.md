abstract: In this study, an artificial neural networks study was carried out to predict
  the compressive strength of ground granulated blast furnace slag concrete. A data
  set of a laboratory work, in which a total of 45 concretes were produced, was utilized
  in the ANNs study. The concrete mixture parameters were three different water-cement
  ratios (0.3, 0.4, and 0.5), three different cement dosages (350, 400, and 450 kg/m3)
  and four partial slag replacement ratios (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%). Compressive strengths
  of moist cured specimens (22 ± 2 °C) were measured at 3, 7, 28, 90, and 360 days.
  ANN model is constructed, trained and tested using these data. The data used in
  the ANN model are arranged in a format of six input parameters that cover the cement,
  ground granulated blast furnace slag, water, hyperplasticizer, aggregate and age
  of samples and, an output parameter which is compressive strength of concrete. The
  results showed that ANN can be an alternative approach for the predicting the compressive
  strength of ground granulated blast furnace slag concrete using concrete ingredients
  as input parameters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

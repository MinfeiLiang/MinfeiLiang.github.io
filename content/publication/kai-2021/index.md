abstract: The fundamental mechanisms under concrete creep are far from being fully
  understood, especially at the molecular level. Hereby, a calcium-silicate-hydrate
  (C-S-H) molecular model is developed to explain, for the first time, the creep characteristics
  at various stress states, temperature levels and water contents, which are not accessible
  experimentally. Rather tensile and compressive loadings, C-S-H only creeps under
  shear loadings originating from the sliding of the calcium silicate layers over
  each other as the interlayer component (water and ions) acts as a lubricator. A
  heterogeneous creep characteristic is observed. Elevated temperature reduces the
  interlayer lubricator viscosity and weakens the interfacial adhesion between the
  layers and the interlayer lubricator, which accelerates C-S-H creep. The removal
  of interlayer water enhances the creep resistance, resulting from the reduced interlayer
  space and enhanced interfacial adhesion. The atomic-level mechanisms explain the
  inter-CSH-particle behaviours at the microscale, which bridges the gap between atomistic
  simulation and microcosmic phenomenon.

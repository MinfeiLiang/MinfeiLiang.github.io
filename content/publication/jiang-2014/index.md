abstract: The present study investigated experimentally autogenous shrinkage behaviors
  of high performance concrete (HPC) containing fly ash (FA) and blast-furnace slag
  (BS) exposed to different isothermal temperatures. The deformation of concrete specimen
  after initial setting was determined using a modified method which is based on non-contact
  measurement technique. The results indicated that the method can precisely monitor
  non-load induced deformations of HPC mixtures. The inclusions of BS and FA resulted
  in significant increase and decrease of autogenous shrinkage of HPC, respectively.
  While both the rate and the magnitude of autogenous shrinkage for almost all mixtures
  were increased with rise of curing temperature, extents of the influence were varied
  with water-binder ratio, composition of cementitious materials and age. It is noted
  that although the equivalent age equation was widely applied to evaluate temperature
  dependence of mechanical properties of cement-based materials, its applicability
  on autogenous shrinkage of HPC was questionable. In addition, on a trial and error
  basis, a modified autogenous shrinkage equation was performed in terms of numerical
  fitting of the measured data. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

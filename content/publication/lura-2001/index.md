abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the influence
  of curing temperature and type of cement [Portland cement and blast-furnace slag
  (BFS) cement] on the autogenous deformations and self-induced stresses in early-age
  concrete. It was found that higher temperatures do not lead to higher deformations
  in the observed period, but generally cause a faster shrinkage and a faster development
  of self-induced stresses. Another experimental finding is that, at the temperatures
  tested, concrete made with BFS cement shows higher shrinkage in the first days than
  concrete made with Portland cement. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

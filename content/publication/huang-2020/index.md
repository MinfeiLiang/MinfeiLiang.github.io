abstract: An accurate prediction of time-dependent autogenous shrinkage behaviors
  of concrete, especially for high performance concrete (HPC) at an early age, is
  of great significance to assess and control the cracking risks of restrained structural
  elements. In this study, based on the capillary tension theory, a mechanistic model
  for evaluating the time-dependent autogenous shrinkage behaviors of high performance
  concrete is proposed. A total of 416 data points including the concrete composition,
  curing condition, age of concrete, water-to-cement (binder) ratio, internal relative
  humidity, elastic modulus, and measured autogenous shrinkage are selectively collected
  for the model establishment. The effects of silica fume on the development of autogenous
  shrinkage are also considered. Upon the sound physical basis, the model requires
  only a few parameter inputs related to the mixture proportion and physicochemical
  properties of constituents. The reasonable agreements between the analytical predictions
  and independent experimental results, as well as common used formulas from different
  codes (i.e., ACI 209, Eurocode 2, and Model Code 2010), demonstrate that the time-dependent
  evolution of autogenous shrinkage of HPC can be reasonably predicted by the model
  proposed in this study.

abstract: 'Modeling the early age evolution of concrete properties is necessary to
  predict the early age behavior of structures. In case of restrained shrinkage or
  application of prestress load [1], creep plays an important role in the determination
  of the effective stress. The difficulty lies in the fact that the modeling of creep
  must be based on experimental data at early age and this data must be obtained automatically
  because the hardening process of the concrete takes place rapidly during the first
  hours and also the first days. This paper presents a new methodology to model basic
  creep in compression since setting. Two kinds of tests are used: classical loadings
  and repeated minute-scale-duration loadings. The classical test is used to characterize
  the creep function for one age at loading and the repeated minute-scale-duration
  loadings test is used to define two ageing factors for the creep function. A new
  model based on the physical mechanisms and the two ageing factors is presented.
  A comparison with the Model Code 2010 is done and an advanced way to consider ageing
  with the Model Code 2010 is presented.'

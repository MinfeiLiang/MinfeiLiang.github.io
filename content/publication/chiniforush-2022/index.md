abstract: Early-age thermal cracking and delayed ettringite formation (DEF) are short-term
  and long-term major issues to the durability of mass concrete and require a high
  level of consideration in the development of a suitable concrete mix design in placement
  and curing strategies, particularly in mixes of high cement content. Where DEF risk
  proves to be significant, contractors are required to adopt risk mitigation strategies
  including lowering concrete's temperature during placement by adding cool water
  or ice, for example, to the mix, embedding cooling pipes in the cast element and/or
  sequential placement of the concrete. These strategies can be implemented at different
  levels, as needed, to minimise the risk of cracking and DEF. Determining the most
  suitable and cost-efficient risk mitigation strategy, however, together with its
  implementation, is a complex task that requires consideration of each complex strategy
  under project-specific conditions. While a significant research effort has been
  invested to develop an improved understanding of the effectiveness of different
  early age thermal cracking and DEF risk mitigation strategies, the lack of reliable
  models capable of simulating and comparing the effectiveness of all scenarios remains
  elusive and considerably limits the ability of the practitioners in identifying
  the optimal approach. This paper presents a Multiphysics model developed to predict
  the effect of early-age thermal cracking and DEF risk mitigation scenarios. The
  model is validated using four real-life project Case Studies and is demonstrated
  to provide reliable results. In addition, the paper studies the comparative effectiveness
  of key risk mitigation strategies and the important parameters influencing their
  effectiveness.

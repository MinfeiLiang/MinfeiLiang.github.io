abstract: Abstract Until now, the standardized methods developed for the detection
  of initial and final setting are destructive and non-continuous. The well-established
  ultrasonic pulse transmission velocity (UPV) method can be correlated to the setting
  process of mortar by the measurement of P-waves. However, S-waves seem to be better
  indicators of the setting of cement-based materials, since they are more sensitive
  to the solid matrix connectivity. This study proposes a new methodology, based on
  the combined monitoring of P- and S-waves, to determine the setting time of mortars
  containing two types of fly ashes. The S-waves velocity and dynamic elastic properties
  seem to be the most accurate indicators of the setting process, allowing capturing
  microstructural evolutions that isothermal calorimetry or usual UPV methods do not
  detect.

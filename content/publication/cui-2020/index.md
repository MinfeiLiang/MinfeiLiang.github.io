abstract: <p>Due to the low hydration rate of high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete
  at early age, the temperature gradient between the concrete core and surfaces could
  be effectively reduced. However, the low hydration rate results in a lack of hydration
  degree for early-age HVFA concrete. Thus, during curing, compared to the strength
  of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), a subsequent lower one of HVFA concrete leads
  to a more sensitive response to inner stresses induced by thermal and moisture loads.
  Based on ABAQUS, in this paper, user subroutines in the temperature and moisture
  fields were developed, with regard to the hydration degree, for simulation of the
  temperature and moisture influences on concrete. Additionally, the Double Power
  Law (DPL) model was used to depict early-age deformations of concrete in the mechanical
  field. Combined with the extended finite element method (XFEM), another subroutine
  for early-age cracking analysis in the mechanical field was then developed. Together
  with aforementioned subroutines, a thermo-hygro-mechanical model is derived. For
  evaluation of early-age cracking initiation and propagation of a pier composed of
  HVFA concrete, the model was implemented with XFEM. The obtained results show that
  (1) temperature and restraints are the main causes of cracking; (2) moisture loss
  affects surface cracks on structures at early age; and (3) although the temperature
  difference between the core and surfaces is not much obvious due to the reduced
  rate of heat dissipation from hydration, cracking of early-age HVFA concrete is
  still likely to happen for its low early strength. Thus, timely curing is critical
  to prevent early cracking.</p>

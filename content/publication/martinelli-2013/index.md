abstract: This paper presents a sound theoretical formulation and an effective numerical
  implementation of a heat-flow and hydration model for concrete hardening. The model
  is based on the Fourier equation of heat flow with the adiabatic hydration curve
  employed as a reference for simulating the hydration heat source. The proposed formulations
  are based on a consistent scheme for the partial differential equation and its boundary
  and starting conditions. The hydration kinetics is simulated through the Arrhenius
  approach. Formulations for the compressive strength and the elastic modulus are
  provided and the maturity function is also considered. A finite difference numerical
  solution is derived with a forward explicit time integration in the time-space domain.
  The numerical solution is designed as a stepwise \"recipe\" specifically conceived
  to be easily implemented by means of either a high-level programming language or
  even a spreadsheet tool. Experimental temperature measurements for two different
  mixtures, under adiabatic and semi-adiabatic conditions, are used for validating
  the proposed model. The adiabatic and semi-adiabatic temperature simulations show
  good agreement with the experimental data for both concrete mixtures. The degree
  of hydration could be simulated and used as the fundamental parameter for scrutinising
  the evolution of the compressive strength. Particularly, a linear trend between
  the compressive strength and the degree of hydration and the maturity was figured
  out. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

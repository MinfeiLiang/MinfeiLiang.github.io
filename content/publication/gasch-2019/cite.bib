 abstract = {Understanding the early-age behaviour of concrete is of importance for designing durable concrete structures. To contribute to the improvement of this, a hygro-thermo-chemo-mechanical model is presented that accounts for phenomena such as hydration, external and internal drying, self-heating, creep, shrinkage and fracture. The model is based on a multiphase porous media framework, using the Thermodynamically Constrained Averaging Theory (TCAT) as starting point to derive the governing equations of the system. This allows for a systematic treatment of the multiscale properties of concrete and how these develop during hydration, e.g. chemical and physical fixation of water. The proposed mathematical model is implemented within the context of the Finite Element Method (FEM), where all physical fields are solved in a fully-coupled manner. Chosen properties of the model are demonstrated and validated using three experimental results from the literature. Generally, the simulated results are in good agreement with the measurements.},

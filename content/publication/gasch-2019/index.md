abstract: Understanding the early-age behaviour of concrete is of importance for designing
  durable concrete structures. To contribute to the improvement of this, a hygro-thermo-chemo-mechanical
  model is presented that accounts for phenomena such as hydration, external and internal
  drying, self-heating, creep, shrinkage and fracture. The model is based on a multiphase
  porous media framework, using the Thermodynamically Constrained Averaging Theory
  (TCAT) as starting point to derive the governing equations of the system. This allows
  for a systematic treatment of the multiscale properties of concrete and how these
  develop during hydration, e.g. chemical and physical fixation of water. The proposed
  mathematical model is implemented within the context of the Finite Element Method
  (FEM), where all physical fields are solved in a fully-coupled manner. Chosen properties
  of the model are demonstrated and validated using three experimental results from
  the literature. Generally, the simulated results are in good agreement with the
  measurements.

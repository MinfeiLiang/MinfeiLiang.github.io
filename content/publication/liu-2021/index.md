abstract: Upon sustained loading, colloidal gels tend to feature delayed viscoplastic
  creep deformations. However, the relationship, if any, between the structure and
  creep dynamics of gels remains elusive. Here, based on accelerated molecular dynamics
  simulations and the recently developed softness approach (i.e., classification-based
  machine learning), we reveal that the propensity of a gel to exhibit long-time creep
  is encoded in its static, unloaded structure. By taking the example of a calcium–silicate–hydrate
  gel (the binding phase of concrete), we extract a local, non-intuitive structural
  descriptor (a revised version of the “softness” metric proposed by the pioneering
  work from Cubuk et al.) that is strongly correlated with the dynamics of the particles.
  Notably, the macroscopic creep rate exhibits an exponential dependence on the average
  softness. We find that creep results in a decrease in softness in the gel structure,
  which, in turn, explains the gradual decay of the creep rate over time. Finally,
  we demonstrate that the softness metric is strongly correlated with the average
  energy barrier that is accessible to the particles.

abstract: 'Monitoring the evolution of early age properties of concrete is necessary
  to provide input data to the models of prediction of the behavior of concrete structures
  since setting time. The experimental challenge lies in the fact that this monitoring
  must be fully automatic since the earliest age because the hardening process of
  the concrete takes place continuously over a period counted in hours and even in
  days after the casting time. This research paper presents a new methodology developed
  at ULB and IFSTTAR to monitor the creep and relaxation of an ordinary concrete chosen
  as reference concrete since setting time. Compressive creep rigs and two test devices
  were used: at ULB, a Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM) specifically designed
  for testing concrete since setting time under free and restraint conditions and
  at IFSTTAR, a test set up called BTJASPE developed to monitor, in compression, the
  modulus of elasticity, the creep and the relaxation of a concrete since very early
  age. For the sake of the study, the same concrete has been used in the two laboratories.
  In addition, this study is performed at a constant temperature to exclude this parameter,
  at this step of the study. The methodology is based on experimental measurements
  with two kinds of test. A classical creep test with permanent loading during one
  week and a repeated minute-long loading test for which every 30 min, a loading is
  applied and kept constant during 5 min and finally totally removed. The classical
  test is used to characterize the non-aging creep function and the repeated minute-long
  loading test is used to quantify the aging creep functions.'

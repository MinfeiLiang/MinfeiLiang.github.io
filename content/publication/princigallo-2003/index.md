abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study of
  the properties of a high-performance Portland cement paste (w/c ratio 0.37; 5% silica
  fume) cured at 20 °C in sealed conditions for 5 days. Properties such as electrical
  conductivity, strength, stiffness, porosity, Vicat penetration, and autogenous deformation
  were measured and modelled. The kinetics of hydration was studied by means of isothermal
  calorimetry. The numerical simulations were performed with CEMHYD3D, developed at
  the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and HYMOSTRUC, developed at
  the Delft University of Technology. The results of the simulations were compared
  with experimental data, and the match was good. Clear correlations were found among
  electrical conductivity, autogenous shrinkage, and connectivity of solids. © 2003

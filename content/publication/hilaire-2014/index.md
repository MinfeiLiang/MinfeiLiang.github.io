abstract: 'A numerical model has been developed to predict early age cracking for
  massive concrete structures, and especially concrete nuclear containment vessels.
  Major phenomena are included: hydration, heat diffusion, autogenous and thermal
  shrinkage, creep and cracking. Since studied structures are massive, drying is not
  taken into account. Such modeling requires the identification of several material
  parameters. Literature data is used to validate the basic creep model. A massive
  wall, representative of a concrete nuclear containment, is simulated; predicted
  cracking is consistent with observation and is found highly sensitive to the creep
  phenomenon. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.'

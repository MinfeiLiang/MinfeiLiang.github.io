abstract: Recent compilation of data on numerous large-span prestressed segmentally
  erected box girder bridges revealed gross underestimation of their multi-decade
  deflections. The main cause has been identified as incorrect and obsolete creep
  prediction models in various existing standard recommendations and is being addressed
  in a separate study. However, previous analyses of the excessive deflections of
  the Koror-Babeldaob (KB) Bridge in Palau and of four Japanese bridges have shown
  that a more accurate method of multi-decade creep analysis is required. The objective
  of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive presentation, appropriate
  not only for bridges but also for any large creep-sensitive structure. For each
  time step, the solution is reduced to an elastic structural analysis with generally
  orthotropic elastic moduli and eigenstrains. This analysis should normally be three-dimensional
  (3-D). It can be accomplished with a commercial finite element code such as ABAQUS.
  Based on the Kelvin chain model, the integral-type creep law is converted to a rate-type
  form with internal variables, which account for the previous history. For time steps
  short enough to render aging during each step to be negligible , a unique continuous
  retardation spectrum for each step is obtained by Laplace transform inversion using
  simple Widder's formula. Discretization of the spectrum then yields the current
  Kelvin chain moduli. The rate-type creep analysis is computation-ally more efficient
  than the classical integral-type analysis. More importantly, though, it makes it
  possible to take into account the evolution of various inelastic and nonlinear phenomena
  such as tensile cracking, cyclic creep, and stress relaxation in prestressing tendons
  at variable strain, as well as the effects of humidity and temperature variations,
  and the effect of wall thickness variation on drying creep and shrinkage. Finally,
  the advantages compared to the existing commercial programs, based on step-by-step
  integration of memory integrals, are pointed out and illustrated by a simple example.

abstract: Automatic detection and segmentation of concrete cracks in tunnels remains
  a high-priority task for civil engineers. Image-based crack segmentation is an effective
  method for crack detection in tunnels. With the development of deep learning techniques,
  especially the development of image segmentation based on convolutional neural networks,
  new opportunities have been brought to crack detection. In this study, an improved
  deep fully convolutional neural network, named as CrackSegNet, is proposed to conduct
  dense pixel-wise crack segmentation. The proposed network consists of a backbone
  network, dilated convolution, spatial pyramid pooling, and skip connection modules.
  These modules can be used for efficient multiscale feature extraction, aggregation,
  and resolution reconstruction which greatly enhance the overall crack segmentation
  ability of the network. Compared to the conventional image processing and other
  deep learning-based crack segmentation methods, the proposed network shows significantly
  higher accuracy and generalization, making tunnel inspection and monitoring highly
  efficient, low cost, and eventually automatable.

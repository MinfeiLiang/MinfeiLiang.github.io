abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based response
  estimation model for structural health monitoring (SHM) of tall buildings subject
  to wind loads. In this model, the wind-induced responses are estimated by CNN trained
  with previously measured sensor signals; this enables the SHM system to operate
  stably even when a sensor fault or data loss occurs. In the presented model, top-level
  wind-induced displacement in the time and frequency domains, and wind data in the
  frequency domain are configured into the input map of the CNN to reflect the resisting
  capacity of a tall building, the change in the dynamic characteristics of the building
  due to wind loads, and the relationship between wind load and the building. To evaluate
  stress, which is used as a safety indicator for structural members in the building,
  the maximum and minimum strains of columns are set as the output layer of the CNN.
  The CNN is trained using measured wind and wind response data to predict the column
  strains during a future wind load. The presented model is validated using data from
  a wind tunnel test of a building model. The performance of the presented model is
  verified through strain estimation with data that were not used in the CNN training.
  To assess the validity of the presented input map configuration, the estimation
  performance is compared with a CNN that considered only the time domain responses
  as input. Furthermore, the effects of the variations in the configuration of the
  CNN on the wind response estimation performance are examined.

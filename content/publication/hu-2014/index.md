abstract: Regarding the significance of Portland cement paste in construction and
  building materials, this work aims to study the mechanical properties of Portland
  cement paste at the micro- and macro-scale, and provide a scientific basis for improving
  the mechanical performances. To fulfill the aim of this work, a comprehensive experimental
  and theoretical micromechanical investigation was performed on Portland cement paste.
  The micromechanical properties of Portland cement paste were investigated by the
  coupled nanoindentation and scanning electron microscope method. The mechanical
  parameters (e.g. indentation modulus and hardness) of individual active phases present
  in Portland cement paste were estimated by the proposed method. From the mechanical
  parameters of Portland cement paste at the micro-scale, the evolution of elastic
  modulus of Portland cement paste at the macro-scale was predicted by a homogenization
  method and the geometries of the main constituents in Portland cement paste were
  taken into account. After verified by the experimental data, it was found that the
  proposed method can provide an accurate prediction of early-age elastic modulus
  of Portland cement paste.

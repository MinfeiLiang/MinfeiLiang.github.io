abstract: The present work analyses the basic creep of concrete compositions for which
  75% of Portland cement is substituted by limestone filler and/or blast furnace slag.
  Compressive creep tests are performed during and after the peak of hydration of
  the slag in order to track the effect of the slag on the development of the creep
  properties. An adapted version of the Model Code 2010 (MC2010) is used to model
  basic creep. It is observed that the high substitution rate of cement by limestone
  filler and/or slag leads to a significant change in the evolution of the viscoelastic
  properties of concrete till a significant degree of reaction of slag is reached.
  It corresponds to the end of the second peak of hydration due to slag. After the
  slag peak of hydration, the basic creep is similar to ordinary Portland cement concrete
  with equivalent water-to-binder ratio. For very early age, a new model is developed
  and is composed of two terms, which consider the hydration of (a) Portland cement
  and (b) slag in the aging of the specific creep function.

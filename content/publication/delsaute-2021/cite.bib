 abstract = {The present work analyses the basic creep of concrete compositions for which 75% of Portland cement is substituted by limestone filler and/or blast furnace slag. Compressive creep tests are performed during and after the peak of hydration of the slag in order to track the effect of the slag on the development of the creep properties. An adapted version of the Model Code 2010 (MC2010) is used to model basic creep. It is observed that the high substitution rate of cement by limestone filler and/or slag leads to a significant change in the evolution of the viscoelastic properties of concrete till a significant degree of reaction of slag is reached. It corresponds to the end of the second peak of hydration due to slag. After the slag peak of hydration, the basic creep is similar to ordinary Portland cement concrete with equivalent water-to-binder ratio. For very early age, a new model is developed and is composed of two terms, which consider the hydration of (a) Portland cement and (b) slag in the aging of the specific creep function.},

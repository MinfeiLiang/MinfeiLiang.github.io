abstract: This paper presents the effect of nano-CaCO3 (NC) on the compressive strengths
  and durability properties of high volume slag (HVS) and high volume slag-fly ash
  (HVS-FA) blended concretes. The study examined the improvement in early and later
  age compressive strengths and durability properties such as sorptivity, volume of
  permeable voids, rapid chloride penetration and drying shrinkage of HVS concrete
  containing 69% blast furnace slag (BFS) and HVS-FA concrete containing combined
  BFS and fly ash (FA) content of 69% due to the addition of 1% NC. Results show that
  the addition of 1% NC improved the compressive strengths of HVS and HVS-FA concretes
  significantly by 43% and 28%, respectively at 3 days compared to the control HVS
  and HVS-FA concretes without NC and exceeded the compressive strengths of control
  OPC concrete at later ages. It is also found that 1% NC inclusion reduced the water
  sorptivity of HVS and HVS-FA concretes reasonably after 28 days of curing and reduction
  is greater after 90 days of curing exhibited comparable water sorptivity to OPC
  concrete. Significant improvement is also observed in reducing the volume of permeable
  voids and controlling the drying shrinkage strain at early age as well as later
  ages of both HVS and HVS-FA concretes due to 1% NC inclusion. Outstanding resistance
  against chloride ion penetration is also observed in HVS and HVS-FA concretes due
  to addition of 1% NC to the very low level of chloride ion penetration according
  to ASTM standard. SEM and EDS analysis revealed a denser microstructure of paste
  and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around aggregates.

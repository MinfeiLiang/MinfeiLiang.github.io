abstract: Early age cracking (EAC) is a well-known problem area when it comes to concrete
  structures. The driving forces behind EAC are thermal dilation and autogenous deformation,
  but EAC is also strongly dependent on material and geometrical properties such as
  hydration heat development, tensile strength, E-modulus, creep, cross-sectional
  dimensions, and degree of restraint. The current document contains a description
  of the EAC design methodology that is currently being implemented in Norway. The
  basis of the methodology is to define and describe the material properties of a
  given concrete through laboratory testing and succeeding model fitting. The obtained
  material parameters are then evaluated and calibrated by comparing (1) stress development
  measured in a Temperature-Stress Testing Machine with (2) stress development calculated
  by using the obtained material properties and various multiphysical EAC calculation
  approaches. Special consideration is given to the effect of realistic curing temperature
  regimes on the various material properties and consequently on the EAC.

 abstract = {Splitting tensile strength (STS) is one of the concrete mechanical properties that are used in structural design. It can be related to numerous parameters, which include compressive strength, water/binder (W/B) ratio and concrete age. Until now, most researchers estimated the STS directly from compressive strength data. This paper suggests formulae that relate STS with that of compressive strength, W/B ratio and concrete age. The predicted STS can be obtained accurately using these formulae. It is proposed that the equation with the concrete age (t) parameter be used in predicting the STS of high-performance concrete (HPC). Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

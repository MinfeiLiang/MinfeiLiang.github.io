abstract: This paper contains a collection of results on Latin hypercube sampling.
  The first result is a Berry-Esseen-type bound for the multivariate central limit
  theorem of the sample mean μ̂n based on a Latin hypercube sample. The second establishes
  sufficient conditions on the convergence rate in the strong law for μ̂n Finally
  motivated by the concept of empirical likelihood, a way of constructing nonparametric
  confidence regions based on Latin hypercube samples is proposed for vector means.

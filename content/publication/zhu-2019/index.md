abstract: In high-performance concrete (HPC) subjected to high temperature during
  tunnel fires, the build-up of vapor pressure due to dehydration of the cement hydration
  products cannot be relieved due to the very low porosity and permeability of this
  type of concrete, often resulting in explosive spalling. Explosive spalling may
  cause devastating damage of the tunnel structure, which threatens both, civilians
  and emergency response units. This work suggests a potential application of silica
  aerogel in the protection of concrete linings, which consists in decorating the
  surface of HPC structures with a highly-insulating aerogel-cement mortar layer,
  with the aim of delaying the heating of the HPC and extending the performance of
  the main concrete structure of the tunnel under fire. The main aim of this study
  is investigating the impact of the microstructure, with special focus on the pore
  structure, on the thermal conductivity and the mechanical properties of the aerogel
  mortars. In particular, the integrity of the aerogels in the mortars, both in the
  mixing process and the possible long-term chemical degradation, was a main concern.
  Finally, a preliminary test of the performance against fire spalling was performed.
  While aerogel-containing mortars were able to protect HPC cubes from fire spalling
  under a specific thermal loading protocol, the thermal conductivity and the mechanical
  properties obtained were similar to those of cellular concrete in the same range
  of total porosity. A possible explanation of the lower-than-expected insulation
  performance is the partial degradation of the aerogel filler by reaction with the
  alkaline pore solution of the mortars. Implications of these new findings on aerogel-cement
  mixtures are also discussed.

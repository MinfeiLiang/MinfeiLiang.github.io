abstract: In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations
  is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to
  the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function
  evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge
  is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint
  functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff
  analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response
  surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal
  functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating
  functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with
  a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization
  lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where
  it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction
  error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems
  which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational
  obstacles can be overcome.

abstract: The classical viscoelastic models for aging materials such as concrete,
  which consist of Volterra history-integral equations, found only limited applications
  since they required storing the entire stress or strain history. Although the sub-
  sequent introduction of the Dirichlet series expansion of the creep or relaxation
  function reduces these requirements by leading to a set of linear differential equa-
  tions equivalent to aging Kelvin or Maxwell chain models, problems arose in the
  identification of the aging moduli of these models. This paper refines and extends
  a recent formulation that remedies these problems by considering the aging to result
  from the progressive solidification of a basic constituent that behaves as a nonaging
  viscoelastic material. The new possibilities explored involve the alter- native
  use of the relaxation function for characterizing the nonaging constituent, and
  the expansion of both the compliance and relaxation functions of the constituent
  into Dirichlet series. In this way, one recovers the rate-type equations of an aging
  Kelvin or Maxwell chain in which all the moduli vary proportionally to a single
  aging function v(t). Some convenient advantages are the well-posedness of the problem
  of moduli identification, with always positive values, and the nonexistence of creep
  or relaxation reversal upon load removal.

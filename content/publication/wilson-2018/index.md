abstract: Current demand for novel highly sustainable concrete urges improving the
  links between chemical and mechanical effects of supplementary cementitious materials
  (SCMs) on the microstructure of blended-cement pastes. In this work, coupled NanoIndentation
  and Quantitative Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy (NI-QEDS) was applied to disclose
  chemo-mechanical properties of microstructure phases in systems incorporating typical
  dosages of fly ash, slag, metakaolin, or glass powder. For a fixed water-to-binder
  ratio of 0.4, the C–(A)–S–H chemistry was significantly affected by the SCMs, while
  its average mechanical properties varied within the limited ranges M ≈ 25–27 GPa,
  H ≈ 0.7–0.8 GPa and C ≈ 180–230 GPa. The SCMs further changed the arrangement of
  anhydrous phases and minor hydrates embedded in the C–(A)–S–H matrix, which were
  also characterized (e.g., Portlandite, AFm such as carboaluminates, or an hydrotalcite-like
  phase). Finally, engineering properties of blended-cement matrices requires tailoring
  both the intermix of hydrates and the rigid anhydrous SCM inclusions.

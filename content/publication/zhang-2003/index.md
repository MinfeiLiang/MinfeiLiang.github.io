abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on the autogenous shrinkage of
  Portland cement concrete (OPC) and concrete incorporating silica fume (SF). The
  results were compared with that of the total shrinkage (including drying shrinkage
  and part of the autogenous shrinkage) of the concrete specimens dried in 65% relative
  humidity after an initial moist curing of 7 days. The water-to-cementitious materials
  (w/c) ratio of the concrete studied was in the range of 0.26 to 0.35 and the SF
  content was in the range of 0% to 10% by weight of cement. The results confirmed
  that the autogenous shrinkage increased with decreasing w/c ratio, and with increasing
  SF content. The results showed that the autogenous shrinkage strains of the concrete
  with low w/c ratio and SF developed rapidly even at early ages. At the w/c ratio
  of 0.26, the autogenous shrinkage strains of the SF concrete were more than 100
  micro strains at 2 days. For all the concretes studied, 60% or more of the autogenous
  shrinkage strain up to 98 days occurred in the first 2 weeks after concrete casting.
  The results indicated that most of the total shrinkage of the concrete specimens
  with very low w/c ratio and SF exposed to 65% relative humidity after an initial
  moist curing of 7 days did not seem to be due to the drying shrinkage but due to
  the autogenous shrinkage. Â© 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

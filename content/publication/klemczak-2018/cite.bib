 abstract = {<p>The current work presents the complex investigation of the influence of cement and aggregate type on the thermo-mechanical behavior of mass concrete. Six types of cement with different amounts of non-clinker constituents and four types of aggregates are used in experimental tests. Particular attention was given to the low clinker cements with high amounts of siliceous fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. The experimental research covered the determination of thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of early age concrete with different constituents. Experimental results have been used both to validate the numerical model and analysis of exemplary foundation slab. The results confirm the importance of the concrete mix composition and it has been shown that the early-age volume deformation and possible cracking is the result of the concerted action of thermal and mechanical properties of concrete. The obtained results indicate granite as the best aggregate for mass concrete. Considering the type of cement, much better behaviour of mass concrete has been noted for cements with fly ash and composite cements containing both fly ash and slags than cements only with slag.</p>},

abstract: <p>The current work presents the complex investigation of the influence
  of cement and aggregate type on the thermo-mechanical behavior of mass concrete.
  Six types of cement with different amounts of non-clinker constituents and four
  types of aggregates are used in experimental tests. Particular attention was given
  to the low clinker cements with high amounts of siliceous fly ash and ground blast
  furnace slag. The experimental research covered the determination of thermal, mechanical,
  and rheological properties of early age concrete with different constituents. Experimental
  results have been used both to validate the numerical model and analysis of exemplary
  foundation slab. The results confirm the importance of the concrete mix composition
  and it has been shown that the early-age volume deformation and possible cracking
  is the result of the concerted action of thermal and mechanical properties of concrete.
  The obtained results indicate granite as the best aggregate for mass concrete. Considering
  the type of cement, much better behaviour of mass concrete has been noted for cements
  with fly ash and composite cements containing both fly ash and slags than cements
  only with slag.</p>

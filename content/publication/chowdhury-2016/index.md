abstract: Computer vision and machine learning methods were applied to the challenge
  of automatic microstructure recognition. Here, a case study on den-dritic morphologies
  was performed. Two classification tasks were completed, and involved distinguishing
  between micrographs that depict dendritic morphologies from those that do not contain
  this particular microstructural feature (Task 1), and from those micrographs identified
  as depicting dendrites, different cross-sectional views (longitudinal or transverse)
  were identified (Task 2). Data sets were comprised of images taken over a range
  of magnifications , from materials with different compositions and varying orientations
  of microstructural features. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction were
  performed prior to training machine learning algorithms to classify mi-crostructural
  image data. Visual bag of words, texture and shape statistics, and pre-trained convolutional
  neural networks (deep learning algorithms) were used for feature extraction. Classification
  was then performed using support vector machine, voting, nearest neighbors, and
  random forest models. For each model, classification was completed using full (original
  size) and reduced feature vectors for each feature extraction method tested. Performance
  comparisons were done to evaluate all possible combinations of feature extraction,
  selection, and classifiers for the task of micrograph classification. Results demonstrate
  that pre-trained neural networks represent microstruc-ture image data well, and
  when used for feature extraction yield the highest classification accuracies for
  the majority of classifier and feature selection methods tested. Thus, deep learning
  algorithms can successfully be applied to micrograph recognition tasks. Maximum
  classification accuracies of 91.85 ± 4.25% and 97.37± 3.33% for Tasks 1 and 2 respectively,
  were achieved. This work is a broad investigation of computer vision and machine
  learning methods that acts as a step towards applying these established methods
  to more sophisticated materials recognition or characterization tasks. The approach
  presented here could offer improvements over established stereological measurements
  by removing the requirement of expert knowledge (bias) for interpretation of image
  data prior to characterization.

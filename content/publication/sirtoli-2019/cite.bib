 abstract = {Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements can be used in concrete as an alternative binder, as full or partial replacement of Portland cement. This enables reducing CO 2 emissions from cement production and offers other advantages, e.g. fast gain of mechanical properties. However, very little data is available on the behaviour of concretes with CSA binders, in particular on their creep and shrinkage. This paper presents a study on volume stability of high-performance concretes with CSA binder, blended with, or completely replacing, Portland-limestone cement. Shrinkage and creep in both autogenous and drying conditions were measured from 1 day until 1 year. The experimental results were compared with the empirical models Model Code 2010 and ACI 209.R-92. The results indicate that standard models originally developed for Portland cement concretes do not allow to address the pronounced differences between the Portland and CSA-based concretes, since their main input data are merely based on compressive strength.},

abstract: Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements can be used in concrete as an alternative
  binder, as full or partial replacement of Portland cement. This enables reducing
  CO 2 emissions from cement production and offers other advantages, e.g. fast gain
  of mechanical properties. However, very little data is available on the behaviour
  of concretes with CSA binders, in particular on their creep and shrinkage. This
  paper presents a study on volume stability of high-performance concretes with CSA
  binder, blended with, or completely replacing, Portland-limestone cement. Shrinkage
  and creep in both autogenous and drying conditions were measured from 1 day until
  1 year. The experimental results were compared with the empirical models Model Code
  2010 and ACI 209.R-92. The results indicate that standard models originally developed
  for Portland cement concretes do not allow to address the pronounced differences
  between the Portland and CSA-based concretes, since their main input data are merely
  based on compressive strength.

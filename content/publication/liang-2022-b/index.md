abstract: This study aims to provide an efficient alternative for predicting creep
  modulus of cement paste based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). First,
  a microscale lattice model for short-term creep is adopted to build a database that
  contains 18,920 samples. Then, 3 DCNNs with different consecutive convolutional
  layers are built to learn from the database. Finally, the performance of DCNNs is
  tested on unseen testing samples. The results show that the DCNNs can achieve high
  accuracy in the testing set, with the R2 all higher than 0.96. The distribution
  of creep modulus predicted by the DCNNs coincides with that of the original data.
  Furthermore, through analyzing the feature maps, it is found that the DCNNs can
  correctly capture the local importance of different microstructural phases. The
  DCNN allows therefore prediction of the creep modulus based on microstructural input,
  which saves computational resources of segmentation procedure and multiple incremental
  FEM calculations.

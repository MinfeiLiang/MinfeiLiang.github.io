abstract: Alkali-activated binders are increasingly used in civil engineering for
  different structural applications. Their thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviour (activation
  process, hydration reactions and mechanical properties' evolution) is investigated
  in the literature. However, few studies addressing their cracking tendency can be
  found. This paper focuses on the cracking risks induced by thermal and delayed strains'
  restriction, at materials' early age. First, the results of an experimental campaign
  comparing the early-age behaviour of an alkali-activated slag mortar to that of
  an OPC based mortar are discussed. Second, a simplified approach allowing comparing
  the cracking tendency of both materials is proposed. The alkali-activated mortar
  undergoes autogenous shrinkage strains higher then OPC mortar and showing an increase
  even at long term. However, its basic creep strains are more important than OPC
  mortar, tested in the same conditions. This implies a higher capacity of stress
  relaxation for the alkali-activated slag mortar. Regarding the evolution of mechanical
  properties, Young modulus and tensile strengths of the alkali-activated mortar are
  lower of those of OPC based mortar at all ages. A simplified cracking index comparison
  applied at this stage of study shows comparable cracking risks of both materials
  at 7 days, higher risks for alkali-activated slag mortar at 28 days.

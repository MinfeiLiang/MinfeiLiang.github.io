abstract: Concrete is one of the most widely used materials in modern civil engineering
  construction. Concrete creep is traditionally defined to be a kind of time-dependent
  behavior exhibited by concrete under sustained constant loads. In this article,
  a new method is proposed to test the short-term creep of concrete and the deformation
  state after unloading process. The test results indicate that after loading, regardless
  of whether the constant load is sustained or not, the specimen exhibits a hysteretic
  recovery after unloading, which challenges the traditional definition of concrete
  creep. In addition, we first observed that the fundamental time-dependent strains
  of concrete, which can be separated from concrete creep under sustained load, could
  peak in several minutes and begin to fall. The long-term creep mainly results from
  unrecoverable deformation, which arises as the recoverable deformation is gradually
  transformed into unrecoverable deformation through micro-damage accumulation. The
  hysteretic recovery and time-dependent behaviors which were discovered reveal the
  fundamental viscoelastic origin of concrete creep.

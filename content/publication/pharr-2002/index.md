abstract: Experiments have shown that nanoindentation unloading curves obtained with
  Berkovich triangular pyramidal indenters are usually well-described by the power-law
  relation P = α(h - hf)m, where hf is the final depth after complete unloading and
  α and m are material constants. However, the power-law exponent is not fixed at
  an integral value, as would be the case for elastic contact by a conical indenter
  (m = 2) or a flat circular punch (m = 1), but varies from material to material in
  the range m = 1.2-1.6. A simple model is developed based on observations from finite
  element simulations of indentation of elastic-plastic materials by a rigid cone
  that provides a physical explanation for the behavior. The model, which is based
  on the concept of an indenter with an \"effective shape\" whose geometry is determined
  by the shape of the plastic hardness impression formed during indentation, provides
  a means by which the material constant in the power law relation can be related
  to more fundamental material properties such as the elastic modulus and hardness.
  Simple arguments are presented from which the effective indenter shape can be derived
  from the pressure distribution under the indenter.

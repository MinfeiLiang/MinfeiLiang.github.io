abstract: Long-term creep prediction has been a major issue of concern in designing
  concrete structures for some time. Many researchers have developed various models
  in order to predict uni-axial compressive concrete creep, however a more precise
  and reliable method of prediction is still required. This investigation introduces
  an inverse analysis (IA) method that utilizes short-term creep measurements under
  certain conditions to predict long-term results under the same conditions. The proposed
  IA method was applied to seven different prediction models and the experimental
  results of six specimens (from three different studies) were chosen to verify the
  reliability of this method. It was concluded that the IA method is able to successfully
  improve the accuracy of prediction and has a comprehensive range of application.

abstract: This study presents comprehensive numerical modeling methods for simulating early‐age stress (EAS) relaxation in cementitious materials, based on the autogenous deformation (AD), elastic modulus, creep, and stress continuously tested by a mini temperature stress testing machine (Mini‐TSTM) and a mini AD testing machine from a very early age (i.e., from a few hours to a week). Four methods for converting creep compliance to relaxation modulus were discussed in detail and used for the one‐dimensional (1D) and three‐dimensional (3D) simulation of stress evolution in the Mini‐TSTM test. Furthermore, virtual creep and relaxation tests were conducted using an exponential algorithm with either the Kelvin or Maxwell chains to show their applicability in simulating the viscoelastic behavior of early‐age cementitious materials. The results showed that the exponential algorithm with the Maxwell chain using an exponential conversion function from creep to relaxation obtains good prediction accuracy of EAS in 3D analysis. The numerical solutions of the Volterra integral of creep compliance can lead to a negative relaxation modulus, thus introducing stress calculation errors in both 1D and 3D analysis.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A Mini-TSTM is devised to allow for efficient stress test, which further enanbles comprehensive numerical study on the stress evolution, particularly on the creep-relaxation conversion in the simulation.

abstract: After a discussion of constitutive models for the non-linear time-dependent
  behaviour of concrete, a new incremental model is presented. It shows some advantages
  over the existing models in this field. It is based on the well-known ageing Maxwell
  chain model for linear viscoelasticity, to which the model fits for low stresses
  as a limiting case. Some aspects concerning the interpretation of the equations
  and how the model can reproduce non-linear creep, creep failure and other typical
  non-linear time-dependent effects are discussed and a description of the numerical
  implementation and the determination of parameters is also given. Finally, some
  results obtained using the model in an example of application are presented, showing
  the capabilities of the model for representing the desired aspects of concrete behaviour.

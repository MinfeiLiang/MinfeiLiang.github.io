abstract: 'The pore structure and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of concrete incorporating
  slag, silica fume and metakaolin were analyzed in this study. Some techniques such
  as mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), microhardness testing and scanning electronic
  microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the effects of slag, silica fume
  and metakaolin on the pore structure, microhardness and morphology of the ITZ at
  28 and 180 days. The traditional properties such as compressive strength were experimentally
  evaluated in relation to pore characteristics and ITZ. Meanwhile, the influence
  of silicon, as the major component of slag, silica fume and metakaolin, on thermodynamic
  stability of hydrate phases was further investigated. The experimental results show
  that mineral admixtures have positive impact on pore refinement and ITZ enhancement
  of concrete especially at later curing stages. The effect of the mineral admixtures
  on microstructure is in the sequence: metakaolin > silica fume > slag. The development
  of the compressive strength is related to the evolution of the pore structure and
  ITZ. Thermodynamic stability analysis indicates that if mineral admixtures are added
  to the CaO-Al2O 3-CaSO4-H2O system, the phase assemblage of C6AsH32 and C3AS0.8H4.4,
  which represents a member of the solid solution series Ca3Al 2(SiO4)3-x(OH)4x, has
  a lower Gibbs free energy of reaction and is therefore thermodynamically more stable
  than monosulfoaluminate at temperatures from 1 to 99 C. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

abstract: <p>Plain cement concrete, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) concrete,
  and fly ash concrete were designed. Three wet curing periods were employed, which
  were 2, 5, and 8 days. The drying shrinkage values of the concretes were measured
  within 1 year after wet curing. The results show that the increasing rate of the
  drying shrinkage of concrete containing a mineral admixture at late age is higher
  than that of plain cement concrete regardless of the wet curing time. With the reduction
  of wet curing time, the increment of total drying shrinkage of concrete decreases
  with the decrease of the W/B ratio. The negative effects on the drying shrinkage
  of fly ash concrete due to the reduction of the wet curing time are much more obvious
  than those of GGBS concrete and plain cement concrete. Superfine ground granulated
  blast furnace slag (SGGBS) can reduce the drying shrinkage of GGBS concrete and
  fly ash concrete when the wet curing time is insufficient.</p>

abstract: 'The current mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG) postulates
  that zero-stress temperature (ZST) has substantial effects on the behavior and performance
  of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. To date, the only available ZST prediction
  model for PCC pavements is the one proposed by the MEPDG, which was quite simplified
  with a function of only two input variables: cementitious content and mean monthly
  temperature for the month of construction. In this study, the feasibility of the
  current ZST prediction model in the MEPDG was assessed by comparing the ZSTs evaluated
  from a series of field tests with the ones estimated from the MEPDG model. In order
  to find ZSTs in actual PCC pavements, accurate evaluations of early-age concrete
  stress developments were essential. To achieve this aim, non-stress cylinders (NCs),
  which directly measure stress-independent strain in the field concrete structures,
  were employed. Once the stress-dependent strain history was estimated based on the
  measured total and stress-independent strain histories, it was converted to the
  stress history using a step-by-step numerical method considering creep and modulus
  developments of concrete. The results of this study showed that about 4.5-7.7 Â°C
  of differences existed between the measured and predicted ZST values. This finding
  strongly suggests a need for development of a more advanced ZST prediction model
  with reasonable assumptions and diverse parameters.'

abstract: 'The relation between basic and drying creep in tension compared to basic
  and drying creep in compression was investigated. The results obtained can be summarized
  as follows. Basic creep in compression is significantly more important than basic
  creep in tension. This difference increases with decreasing concrete age at loading.
  Compression creep and tension creep are similar under drying conditions. Analysis
  of these results provides insight into the physical mechanism underlying basic creep
  in concrete: microcrack initiation generates additional strains related to the development
  of additional self-drying shrinkage. We thus propose that basic creep in concrete
  is mainly caused by additional self-drying shrinkage under stress. Â© 2013 Elsevier

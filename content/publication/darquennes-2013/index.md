abstract: Addition of slag modifies the hydration process of cement and the evolution
  of the mechanical properties of concrete. In this study, the advancement of hydration
  was monitored for concretes with different blast-furnace slag contents using several
  techniques such as adiabatic calorimetry, thermogravimetry and analysis by scanning
  electron microscopy. Results show clearly the slowdown of the hydration for slag
  cement concretes. A fundamental parameter describing the hydration process and the
  evolution of the microstructure, named the degree of hydration, is quantified for
  the slag cement concretes. It appears that the method based on the evolution of
  the chemically bound water gives the most reliable evolution of the hydration degree.
  The knowledge of this parameter allows predicting correctly the evolution of compressive
  strength and Young modulus at early age for concretes with high slag content using
  an analytical model based on the degree of hydration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

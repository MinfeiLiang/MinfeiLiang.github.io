abstract: Relative humidity plays a critical role in concrete creep. To accurately
  measure and model creep behavior of concrete considering the relative humidity effect
  is difficult despite more than 100 years of research of concrete creep. In this
  study, a test set-up was designed to measure the creep-induced deflection of concrete
  beams exposed to different drying conditions (sealed and symmetric drying). AÂ numerical
  method is proposed to quantify the creep parameters of concrete considering the
  relative humidity effect. The sequential coupled hydromechanical finite element
  analysis was conducted to back-calculate the creep parameters in the microprestress
  solidification theory-based creep model from the measured creep-induced deflection.
  It was found that the obtained parameters are independent of the loading and drying
  conditions. One set of parameters can predict the creep-induced deflection of concrete
  beams exposed to different drying conditions. The findings in this study provide
  a new methodology to obtain the creep parameters which can be implemented numerically
  for analyzing creep behavior of various concrete structures without considering
  the drying-related size effect.

abstract: An improved law of creep of concrete at constant humidity and temperature
  is proposed. The well-known double power law gives too high a final slope of creep
  curves compared to available test data. This is remedied by a new formula which
  exhibits a continuous transition from a power curve to a straight line in the logarithm
  of creep duration. The straight line has the same slope for all ages at loading,
  and the higher the age at loading, the longer is the duration at which the transition
  occurs. The exponent of the initial power curve is higher than that used in the
  double power law and is much too high in comparison with the existing test results
  for very short load durations in the dynamic range. This penalty, however, is outweighed
  by better extrapolation to very long load durations. The new formula significantly
  restricts the occurrence of divergence of creep curves at various ages at loading
  but does not eliminate it completely unless closeness of data fit is sacrificed.
  The new formula also greatly reduces the occurrence of negative values at the end
  of calculated stress relaxation curves. Extensive statistical analysis of most test
  data available in the literature reveals a relatively modest improvement in the
  overall coefficient of variation for the deviations of the formula from test data
  and a significant improvement for the deviations of the final slope from its measured
  value. The same improvements were achieved in an earlier study in which the transition
  from the power law to the logarithmic law was abrupt, with a discontinuity in curvature.
  The continuity of curvature in the present formulation is desirable for applications
  in data extrapolation.

abstract: The Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is well established in such a way that engineers
  are very confident with the determination of the stress field or deflections of
  the elastic beam based on this theory. In contrast, Timoshenko theory is not so
  much used by engineers. However, in some cases, Euler–Bernoulli theory, which neglects
  the effect of transversal shear deformation, yields unacceptable results. For instance,
  when dealing with visco-elastic behavior, shear deformations play a fundamental
  role. Recent studies on the response evaluation of a visco-elastic Euler–Bernoulli
  beam under quasi-static and dynamic loads have been stressed that for better capturing
  of the visco-elastic behavior, a fractional constitutive law has to be considered.
  In this context, it has been provided that if the homogeneous beam correspondence
  principle also holds, then the study of a fractional visco-elastic Euler–Bernoulli
  beam may be derived from the elastic one. As mentioned before, when dealing with
  visco-elasticity the Timoshenko beam model is more appropriate than Euler–Bernoulli’s
  one, and this paper provides important information to engineering designers, introducing
  exact linking relationships between elastic Euler–Bernoulli beam response and fractional
  visco-elastic Timoshenko beam response. Ready-to-use tables and a straightforward
  formulation have been provided leading to significant analysis cost savings and
  improved quality.

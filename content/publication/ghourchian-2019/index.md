abstract: In this study, a continuum poromechanics approach is presented to model
  the plastic shrinkage cracking of fresh cementitious materials. The boundary conditions
  are according to the modified ASTM C1579â€“13 standard for mortars. The restrained
  deformations are linked to the restraint stresses according to the Cauchy-Navier
  equations of elasticity, assuming an incremental stress-strain relationship. The
  Bresler-Pister and Rankine failure criteria are utilized to model failure. The material
  parameters are adapted according to the Drucker-Prager and Griffith criteria. The
  crack initiation and propagation is verified experimentally by X-ray radiography.
  Eventually, the cracking mechanism is discussed and a safe capillary pressure limit
  is proposed. It is found that capillary pressure stiffening occurring before air
  entry, when deformations take place in the saturated state, is the predominant cause
  of plastic shrinkage cracking in the drying state.

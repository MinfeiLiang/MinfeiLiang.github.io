abstract: 'Autogenous shrinkage is an important factor for cracking of cement-based
  materials at early ages. This review summarizes different definitions and testing
  methods for autogenous shrinkage in literature. Autogenous shrinkage should be defined
  as the sum of chemical shrinkage and self-desiccation shrinkage. All testing methods
  in the literature can be divided into two categories: Direct and indirect testing
  methods. Direct testing methods usually measure volumetric or linear dimensional
  changes. Indirect methods usually measure porosity or change in relative humidity
  of cement- based materials, which can reflect the change in autogenous shrinkage.
  Indirect methods need to establish correlations between autogenous shrinkage and
  porosity or relative humidity. Â© 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.'

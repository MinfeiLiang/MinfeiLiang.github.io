abstract: To elucidate the effect of aggregate size and volume on the non-uniform
  strain distribution in concrete, drying shrinkage of mortar and concretes were determined
  with 3D digital image correlation (3D-DIC). The distribution of shrinkage displacements
  and strains in mortar and concrete were analyzed. The results show that 3D-DIC makes
  it possible to measure non-uniform displacement distributions initiated by shrinkage
  in mortar and concrete. The non-uniformity became more remarkable with drying time.
  The presence of aggregates larger than 5 mm in concrete have locally changed the
  displacement and strain fields. Aggregates within 5â€“25 mm make non-uniform strain
  of concrete more fluctuant, especially when the aggregate size is larger than 10
  mm. The maximum and minimum principal strain distributions became more heterogeneous
  with decreasing volume of aggregates.

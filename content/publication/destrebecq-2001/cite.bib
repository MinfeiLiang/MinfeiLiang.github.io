 abstract = {<p>A method is presented for the numerical analysis of creep, shrinkage, and relaxation in concrete bridges. The method is based on an incremental analysis of the behavior of a viscoelastic composite member and on the use of a classic finite beam element. One of the main advantages of the method is its ability to take the structure constitution and the material behaviors into account in a very precise manner for low calculation cost—limited numbers of finite elements and calculation steps. Also, the processes of construction, prestressing, and free strain development are easily taken into account. The method is compared with test results for two prestressed concrete beams. Finally, the method is applied to the time analysis of a cable‐stayed footbridge.</p>},

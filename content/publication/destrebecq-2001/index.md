abstract: <p>A method is presented for the numerical analysis of creep, shrinkage,
  and relaxation in concrete bridges. The method is based on an incremental analysis
  of the behavior of a viscoelastic composite member and on the use of a classic finite
  beam element. One of the main advantages of the method is its ability to take the
  structure constitution and the material behaviors into account in a very precise
  manner for low calculation cost—limited numbers of finite elements and calculation
  steps. Also, the processes of construction, prestressing, and free strain development
  are easily taken into account. The method is compared with test results for two
  prestressed concrete beams. Finally, the method is applied to the time analysis
  of a cable‐stayed footbridge.</p>

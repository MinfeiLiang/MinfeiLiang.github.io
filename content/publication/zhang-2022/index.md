abstract: In this paper, both synthetic slag and commercial slag covering the common
  composition range were employed to estimate the correlation between slag chemistry
  and reactivity through hydraulicity and dissolution tests. It was found that slag
  reactivity was favorably affected by increasing Al2O3 and MgO contents, while the
  adverse effect of decreasing CaO/SiO2 ratio could be compensated by higher amounts
  of Al2O3 and/or MgO. When calorimetric measurement was used to assess the reactivity
  of slag, the effect of sulfur species incorporated in commercial slag should be
  taken into consideration as a small quantity of it could lead to a major difference
  of cumulative heat release due to the formation of ettringite. Moreover, a novel
  graphical method was proposed to estimate the reactivity of slag considering its
  chemical composition from a new perspective, i.e. a cartesian coordinate system
  based on (CaO/SiO2)−(MgO + Al2O3).

 abstract = {<p>Slag rim mainly consists of secondary precipitations such as C–S–H gel phase and hydrotalcite-like phase, which originate from the hydration of slag. In this paper, the micro-mechanical properties of slag rim were characterized by nanoindentation in combination with SEM. It was found that, compared to the C–S–H gel phase, slag rim showed about a 15 GPa higher modulus of elasticity. At the early age, slag cement paste mainly consisted of low-density C–S–H gel phase, high-density C–S–H gel phase, and unhydrated slag particles, as well as calcium hydroxide based on the results of nanoindentation; at the later age, the system contained C–S–H gel phase, slag rim (a mixture of C–S–H gel phase and hydrotalcite-like phase), and unhydrated slag particles.</p>},

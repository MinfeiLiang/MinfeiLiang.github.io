abstract: The microstructure of material strongly influences its mechanical properties
  and the microstructure itself is influenced by the processing conditions. Thus,
  establishing a Process-Structure-Property relationship is a crucial task in material
  design and is of interest in many engineering applications. We develop a GAN (Generative
  Adversarial Network) to synthesize microstructures based on given processing conditions.
  This approach is devoid of feature engineering, needs little domain awareness, and
  can be applied to a wide variety of material systems. Results show that our GAN
  model can produce high-fidelity multi-phase microstructures which have a good correlation
  with the given processing conditions.

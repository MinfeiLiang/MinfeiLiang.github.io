abstract: <p>Most of segmental prestressed concrete box girders exhibit excessive
  multidecade deflections unforeseeable by past and current design codes. To investigate
  such a behavior, mainly caused by creep and shrinkage phenomena, an effective finite
  element (FE) formulation is presented in this article. This formulation is developed
  by invoking the stationarity of an energetic principle for linear viscoelastic problems
  and relies on the Bazant creep constitutive law. A case study representative of
  segmental prestressed concrete box girders susceptible to creep is also analyzed
  in the article, that is, the Colle Isarco viaduct. Its FE model, based on the aforementioned
  energetic formulation, was successfully validated through the comparison with monitoring
  field data. As a result, the proposed 1D FE model can effectively reproduce the
  past behavior of the viaduct and predict its future behavior with a reasonable run
  time, which represents a decisive factor for the model implementation in a decision
  support system.</p>

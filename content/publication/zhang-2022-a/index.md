abstract: <p>Slag rim mainly consists of secondary precipitations such as C–S–H gel
  phase and hydrotalcite-like phase, which originate from the hydration of slag. In
  this paper, the micro-mechanical properties of slag rim were characterized by nanoindentation
  in combination with SEM. It was found that, compared to the C–S–H gel phase, slag
  rim showed about a 15 GPa higher modulus of elasticity. At the early age, slag cement
  paste mainly consisted of low-density C–S–H gel phase, high-density C–S–H gel phase,
  and unhydrated slag particles, as well as calcium hydroxide based on the results
  of nanoindentation; at the later age, the system contained C–S–H gel phase, slag
  rim (a mixture of C–S–H gel phase and hydrotalcite-like phase), and unhydrated slag
  particles.</p>

abstract: "<p> Early‐age stress (EAS) is an important index for evaluating the early‐age
  cracking risk of concrete. This paper encompasses a thermo‐chemo‐mechanical (TCM)
  model and active ensemble learning (AEL) for predicting the EAS evolution. The TCM
  model provides the data for the AEL model. First, based on Fourier's law, Arrhenius’
  equation, and rate‐type creep law, a TCM model is built to simulate the heat transfer,
  cement hydration, and viscoelasticity, which together determine the EAS evolution.
  Then, a material model composed of an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model and adjusted
  Model Code 2010 is built to allow for parametric study and database construction.
  Finally, an AEL framework is built, which incorporates principal component analysis
  (PCA), Gaussian process, and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM). This study
  resulted in the following findings: (1) The dimensionality of the 672‐by‐1 EAS vector
  can be effectively reduced by PCA, and the first principal component (PC) is a global
  index representing the magnitude of the EAS; (2) the mechanical field of the TCM
  model is validated by testing data. Correlation analysis on the first PC quantifies
  the influence of various input parameters of the TCM model, which is in accordance
  with common understandings of the EAS evolution process. (3) The AEL and one‐shot
  ensemble learning (OSEL) both achieve high prediction performance in the testing
  set, whose <italic>R</italic> <sup>2</sup> reaches 0.961 and 0.948, respectively.
  Thanks to the uncertainty‐based query procedure, comparing with OSEL, AEL shows
  advantages in prediction performance over the whole training history. (4) AEL can
  significantly reduce the number of samples required for training, which can be a
  major improvement in efficiency considering the computational cost of the TCM model.

abstract: Experimental research on concrete creep with different strengths under various
  ambient relative humidity was carried out. Based on certainty creep models provided
  in CEB-FIP Model Code 1990 and Model Code 2010, the Latin hypercubic sampling method
  was used to establish uncertainty models of concrete creep, and the sensitivity
  of concrete strength and ambient relative humidity to models was analyzed. Experimental
  results show that the creep coefficient has a negative correlation with concrete
  strength and ambient relative humidity, and the latter influences creep more than
  the former. In addition, the sensitivity of ambient relative humidity and concrete
  strength for CEB-FIP MC 90 and MC 2010 models changes with the variation of coefficients.
  Under different environmental conditions, there is deviation between the tested
  creep coefficients and theoretical values by certainty creep models, while the experimental
  data are within the 95% confidence interval of CEB-FIP MC 90 model, indicating that
  the presented numerical method for calculating the 95% confidence interval of the
  creep coefficient is reliable.

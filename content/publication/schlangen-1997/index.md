abstract: This paper addresses some lattice model techniques used in numerical simulations
  of fracture in concrete and other random materials. The influence of lattice element
  type and lattice orientation on the fracture pattern was investigated by simulating
  a shear loading experiment on a concrete plate. Beam elements with three degrees
  of freedom per node, and with a random orientation of the beams within the lattice,
  gave the best comparison with experiment. The effect of element resolution on fracture
  results was also investigated. A new fracture law has been developed that uses principal
  tensile stresses in each node of the lattice to determine which beam should break
  at every step of a simulation. For the implementation of heterogeneity in the model,
  a method has been developed that uses digital images of the real microstructure
  of a material. Simulated crack patterns were obtained for a real material , using
  this technique, which appear quite realistic. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

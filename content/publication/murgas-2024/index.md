abstract: <p>Image-based micromechanical models, necessary for the development of
  structure-property-response relations, are far from mature for complex microstructures
  with multi-modal distributions of morphological and crystallographic features, such
  as those occurring with cold spray-formed (CSF) aluminum alloys. These materials
  have a bimodal polycrystalline microstructure composed of recrystallized ultra-fine
  grains (UFGs) and deformed coarse grains (CGs) within prior particles. A prime reason
  is the lack of robust approaches for generating statistically equivalent virtual
  microstructures (SEVM) capturing the statistics of characteristic morphological
  and crystallographic features, such as grain size, crystallographic orientations,
  and misorientations. This paper introduces an approach, strategically integrating
  Generative Adversarial Network-based approaches for producing bimodal CSF AA7050
  alloy microstructures, with the synthetic microstructure builder Dream3D for packing
  prior particles with CGs having statistically equivalent morphological and crystallographic
  descriptors to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps. An efficient finite
  element (FE) simulation approach is developed for the SEVMs to generate local and
  overall response functions through the creation of sub-volume elements (SVEs).</p>

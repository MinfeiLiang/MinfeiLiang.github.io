 abstract = {<p>A micromechanical model for moisture diffusion within concrete and the associated shrinkage of concrete is presented in this paper. The model is based on the micropore structure of the concrete and the thermodynamic behaviour of the water in the pores. The drying shrinkage behaviour, both time-dependent moisture loss and volumetric change, of mortar and concrete specimens is analysed under various conditions. The suitability and applicability ofthe proposed model are discussed on the basis ofthe results.</p>},

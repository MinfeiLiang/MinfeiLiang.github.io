abstract: A well-known fact is that the mechanical properties of cement-based materials
  largely depend on the material structure at the micro- and nano-scales. To understand
  and improve the macroscopic mechanical performances of cement-based materials, it
  is essential to investigate the mechanical properties of cement-based materials
  at the micro- and nano-scales. Benefited from the application of the nanoindentation
  technique, a lot of valuable microstructural mechanical information of cement-based
  materials has been reported during the last decade. As the application of nanoindentation
  gains more and more interests from the researchers in the field of construction
  and building materials, this paper aims to provide an overview on this important
  technique in application to cement-based materials, and present a comprehensive
  review on the mechanical properties of cement-based materials measured by nanoindentation.
  In the review, the nanoindentation methods that had been used and the findings that
  had been reported were summarized. Meanwhile, the critical aspects of nanoindentation
  in application to cement-based materials were discussed.

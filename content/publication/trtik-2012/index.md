abstract: A surface of epoxy-impregnated hardened cement paste was investigated using
  a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging mode that allows for the quantitative
  mapping of the local elastic modulus. The analyzed surface was previously prepared
  using focussed ion beam milling. The same surface was also characterized by electron
  microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate the capability
  of this quantitative nanomechanical mapping to provide information on the local
  distribution of the elastic modulus (from about 1 to about 100 GPa) with a spatial
  resolution in the range of decananometers, that corresponds to that of low-keV back-scattered
  electron imaging. Despite some surface roughness which affects the measured nanomechanical
  properties it is shown that topography, adhesion and Young's modulus can be clearly
  distinguished. The quantitative mapping of the local elastic modulus is able to
  discriminate between phases in the cement paste microstructure that cannot be distinguished
  from the corresponding back-scattered electron images. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

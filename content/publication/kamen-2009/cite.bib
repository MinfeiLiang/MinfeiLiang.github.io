 abstract = {Ultra high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) early age viscoelastic behaviour under tension was investigated. The tests results showed a high creep potential due to the high volume paste (88%). This result is of major importance because the viscoelastic properties contribute to mitigating the high early age stresses generated under restrained shrinkage. This beneficial effect was reflected by the increased linear-relationship between tensile creep and shrinkage. As expected, UHPFRC tensile creep behaviour was also sensitive to the loading level. Above 35% of the tensile strength at the loading age, the material exhibited viscoplastic behaviour. A Maxwell chain model was applied to predict the early age UHPFRC tensile creep and confirms the induced non-linear response. © 2008 RILEM.},

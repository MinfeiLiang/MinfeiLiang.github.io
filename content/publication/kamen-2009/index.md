abstract: Ultra high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) early age viscoelastic
  behaviour under tension was investigated. The tests results showed a high creep
  potential due to the high volume paste (88%). This result is of major importance
  because the viscoelastic properties contribute to mitigating the high early age
  stresses generated under restrained shrinkage. This beneficial effect was reflected
  by the increased linear-relationship between tensile creep and shrinkage. As expected,
  UHPFRC tensile creep behaviour was also sensitive to the loading level. Above 35%
  of the tensile strength at the loading age, the material exhibited viscoplastic
  behaviour. A Maxwell chain model was applied to predict the early age UHPFRC tensile
  creep and confirms the induced non-linear response. © 2008 RILEM.

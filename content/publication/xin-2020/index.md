abstract: This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of uniaxial restraint tests
  for evaluation of behavior and cracking potential of early-age cementitious systems
  in the last five decades. Histories of design concept and improvement of uniaxial
  restraint tests (longitudinal-passive and longitudinal-active test) have been introduced.
  Particularly, analytical methods of restraint degree and restrained stress, sensitivity
  analysis of uniaxial restraint test parameter, as well as cracking potential evaluation
  with respect to their application rationalities are addressed, which are extended
  contents compared with the last review in early 2000s. Finally, challenges and perspectives
  of uniaxial restraint tests for evaluation of behavior and cracking potential of
  cementitious systems are given for future improvement.

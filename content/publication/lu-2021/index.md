abstract: Shrinkage-induced cracking can impair the durability of concrete structures.
  In the past few decades, this topic has drawn more and more attention. Shrinkage
  of mortar and concrete is actually the result of the interaction between the shrinking
  cement paste and the non-shrinking aggregates. In recent years, different models
  that consider the restraining effect of aggregates, i.e. Series model and Hobbsâ€™
  model, have been proposed to predict the autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete.
  However, in these models both aggregate particles and cement paste matrix are considered
  as elastic materials. In fact, cement paste is not ideally elastic. Creep also plays
  an important role in autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete. In this paper
  an extended Pickett model, which takes the effect of creep into consideration, is
  proposed. The autogenous shrinkage of CEM I and CEM III/B cement mortar and concrete
  is simulated by using this model and compared with the experimental results to evaluate
  the accuracy of the predictions. The results show that the extended Pickett model
  can well predict the autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete.

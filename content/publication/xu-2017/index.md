abstract: Multiple Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM) in large quantities
  have been used in quasi-mass concrete to minimize the crack risk. Yet the hydration
  process of concrete with high volume addition of SCM, especially effect of temperature
  on the early stage hydration, has been rarely investigated. In this paper, early
  age hydration progress and mechanical properties of concrete with high volume GGBS
  and FA were studied under different curing temperatures. The results show that high
  volume GGBS and FA accelerate the cement hydration in early age due to the dilution
  and filler effects. However, the hydration was slowed down when the addition of
  FA is up to 55% and 70%. Compared to binders with GGBS, the hydration process of
  binders with FA are more sensitive to temperature. The results also imply the necessity
  of the introduction of a range factor of hydration degree for effective estimation
  of Ea for binders with high volume of SCM. The equivalent age equation effectively
  predicts the early age strength development of high volume SCM concrete curing under
  changing temperature in an actual structure and what needed to do is to modify the
  activation energy by considering the hydration progress of binder with high volume
  SCM.

abstract: In this study, the early-age strain-stress development of mixtures containing
  slag cement was measured on uniaxially restrained specimens using a specially designed
  testing frame starting right after casting. It was found that thermal deformation
  dominates early-age stress development in low w/cm and low slag cement paste systems.
  While for concrete, autogenous shrinkage is the major contributing factor for tensile
  stress development. The early-age stress development of uniaxially restrained cementitious
  mixture specimens is profoundly influenced by the overt early-age relaxation effect,
  such that the compressive stress is significantly reduced and tensile stress develops
  before shrinkage begins. A linear shrinkage and tensile stress relationship is found
  to exist in mixtures subject to such constant restraint, regardless of w/cm and
  slag cement contents. Slag cement has the benefit of delaying tensile stress development
  and cracking time because of the reduced early-age thermal effect as compared to
  the ordinary Portland cement mixture. The cracking of the slag cement mixture is
  mainly due to the greater long-term autogenous shrinkage. The cracking time is found
  closely related to the shrinkage rate rather than the shrinkage magnitude, a unique
  relationship can be used to describe such phenomenon.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

abstract: '<p>This paper reports on the characterisation and quantitative analysis
  of ettringite in the hydration products of several high-alite cements. The study
  has three main parts: (a) the investigation of the microscopic morphology of ettringite;
  (b) an X-ray diffraction characterisation; and (c) a quantitative analysis of the
  ettringite in the hardened cement pastes. The results show that the ettringite could
  be selectively extracted by an ethylene glycol/methanol solvent with a volume ratio
  of 1:3, which thereby proved to be an effective method for the quantitative analysis
  of ettringite. Combined with the results of the X-ray diffraction analysis, the
  formation and transformation mechanisms of ettringite could be characterised and
  described in more detail. During the 90-d aging period, the reaction degree of the
  coal gangue was higher than that of fly ash and had a greater impact on the formation
  and transformation of ettringite. The amount of ettringite formed from the hydration
  of coal gangue cement was higher than that from neat Portland cement, whereas the
  amount of ettringite formed from the hydration of fly ash cement was lower than
  that from neat Portland cement.</p>'

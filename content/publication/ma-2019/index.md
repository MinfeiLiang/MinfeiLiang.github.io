abstract: Autogenous shrinkage based on different “time-zero” may result in underestimation/overestimation
  on the cracking potential of alkali-activated fly ash/slag (AAFS). This study reports
  an experimental investigation on the “time-zero” of AAFS pastes characterized by
  different techniques. It is found that the internal capillary pressure in AAFS pastes
  significantly increased after 5–7.5 h, which is far beyond the final setting time
  that is normally regarded as “time-zero” for Portland cement. The transition time
  derived from capillary pressure method directly captures the alteration of capillary
  stress in AAFS, which matches well with the change of the shrinkage slope. Due to
  the moisture equilibrium between the specimens and humidity sensor, it is hard to
  use the measured internal relative humidity to determine the real “time-zero” of
  AAFS. This research finds that the onset of capillary pressure in AAFS paste provides
  a more scientific and accurate determination of “time-zero”.

abstract: Tensile and compressive creep tests of fly ash concretes in the hardening
  phase have been performed in the Temperature-Stress Testing Machine (TSTM) at NTNU.
  All tests were performed under nominally identical conditions, e.g. dimensions,
  curing conditions, measurement set-up and load-regime. Two concretes with 17% and
  33% fly ash (as % by weight of cement and fly ash content) were investigated. Contradictorily
  to most of the compressive versus tensile creep comparisons found in the literature,
  both the investigated concretes showed similar creep behaviour in compression and
  tension throughout the hardening phase. It was also seen that for the investigated
  time-span, the specific creep development over time was found to increase (i.e.
  soften) with increasing amount of fly ash.

abstract: This paper investigates the mechanisms of microstructure evolution of interfacial
  transition zone (ITZ) in alkali-activated fly ash-slag (AAFS) concrete using scanning
  electron microscope. Results indicate that the formation of original ITZ depends
  on the so-called “wall effect”, leading to a deficit of large grains and a higher
  effective alkaline activator/precursor ratio compared to paste matrix. The alkaline
  reaction process is correspondingly accelerated, which promotes the formation of
  low Ca C-(N)-A-S-H gels and reduces the porosity in the ITZ. Afterwards, the high
  Ca C-(N)-A-S-H gels are generated due to the release of more Ca from slag, resulting
  in the continuous refinement of pores. The C-(N)-A-S-H gels with rich Si and Al
  are then produced at 7 d, attributing to the species diffusion from paste matrix
  to ITZ. Consequently, a compact and dense microstructure is formed in the ITZ at
  28 d, which would be beneficial to the long-term performance of concrete.

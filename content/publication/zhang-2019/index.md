abstract: This study presents experimental results on the shrinkage behavior of ultra-high
  performance concrete (UHPC), including the shrinkage development pattern, the calculation
  of autogenous shrinkage strain and the steel fiber restraining effect. UHPC is found
  to exhibit a multi-stage shrinkage characteristic. During the first two dormant
  stages, shrinkage is mainly composed of thermal contraction when limited hydration
  reaction occurs. Rapid shrinkage development commences once hydration is accelerated,
  leading to pore moisture depletion and pore refinement. In the later stage, shrinkage
  gradually levels off due to the decreasing hydration reactivity and the stiffening
  matrix. Autogenous shrinkage is separated by the removal of thermal strain based
  on the knowledge of coefficient of thermal deformation (CTD). This leads to the
  appearance of a transient swelling segment which may be attributed to the formation
  of Ca(OH)2 and ettringite crystals generating expansive stresses. Addition of steel
  fibers is found to reduce the shrinkage strain significantly. Its shrinkage restraining
  effect is a result of the matrix-fiber interfacing bonding and is numerically characterized
  by a mathematical model with the volume fraction and geometrical features of steel
  fibers as the major variables.

abstract: Semi-adiabatic calorimetry and a rigid cracking frame were used to compare
  the effects of five different ground granulated blast-furnace slags with variable
  Al2O3 and MgO contents, but similar CaO/SiO2 ratios on early-age cracking resistance.
  While cement replacement with slag significantly reduced concrete temperature rise
  and delayed the time of cracking compared to the plain concrete, it was observed
  that stress development varied with the MgO/Al2O3 ratio of the slag. Increasing
  this ratio reduced the cracking temperature and delayed the time of cracking. The
  worst performance of the low MgO/Al2O3 ratio slag was attributed to its higher early-age
  reactivity, which was confirmed by isothermal calorimetry in addition to its higher
  autogenous shrinkage assessed by free shrinkage measurements.

abstract: In Portland cement-based concrete, calcium (alumino) silicate hydrate (C-(A-)S-H)
  is the principal binding phase that governs its physical, mechanical, and durability
  properties. In this study, micromechanical properties of compacts made of synthetic
  C-(A-)S-H powder were investigated with nanoindentation, and various influencing
  factors were identified. It was revealed that a normal distribution and convergence
  of test data could be attained with an indentation depth > 350 nm. Higher conditioning
  relative humidity, pressure, and holding time aided consolidation of the powder
  and led to an improved elastic modulus. No remarkable influence of strain rate (0.025–0.1
  s−1) and vibration frequency was noted. While the Al-incorporated C-A-S-H exhibited
  superior mechanical properties relative to C-S-H, all the C-(A-)S-H compacts yielded
  lower elastic modulus values as compared to data from fully hydrated C3S paste,
  mainly attributable the phase bonding, packing density, chemical composition, and
  the presence of phases other than C-(A-)S-H in the C3S sample.

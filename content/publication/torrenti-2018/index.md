abstract: The basic creep of concrete is the delayed deformation that occurs when
  concrete is subjected to loading without drying. This paper analyzes some findings
  from the literature. The derivatives of the compliance function J of basic creep
  tests with different loading ages t0 are compared. It has been observed that when
  dJ/dt is considered as a function of time t, the long-term behavior is logarithmic
  with a uniform slope. This indicates that basic creep could be expressed as a logarithmic
  function in which the age of loading does not affect the final slope. In the recent
  fib Model Code 2010 (MC2010), basic creep is expressed exactly in this way. Using
  experimental data, the parameters of the model are calculated for each test and
  compared with the values proposed by MC2010. It is shown that MC2010 gives a fairly
  good set of values for the parameters whose accuracy could nevertheless be improved
  by adjusting these parameters to match experimental results.

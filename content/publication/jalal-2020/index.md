abstract: In the present paper, the design of optimized rubber concrete composite
  containing silica fume (SF) and zeolite (ZE) was undertaken using the literature,
  and the properties were assessed through destructive and non-destructive (NDT) methods.
  In order to optimize the rubberized cement composite, the optimum tradeoff between
  compressive strength as the main objective and rubber content, as well as the optimum
  fractions of the admixtures were taken into account. Main tests including workability,
  compressive strength, elastic modulus, and ultrasonic tests were carried out to
  fully assess the effects of rubber, ZE, SF, curing, and age on the rubberized composite
  behavior. Primary and secondary wave velocities, i.e. Vp and Vs were determined
  from ultrasonic test to characterize different mixtures. Static modulus results
  obtained from NDT were compared, and it was found that NDT results were in very
  good agreement with those of destructive test results. Moreover, the dynamic elastic
  modulus determined from compression and shear wave velocities (Vp, Vs) conforming
  to ASTM were compared with those estimated from six different relationships including
  BS, EN and ACI relationships along with other well-known equations available in
  the literature. In order to predict the compressive strength of the rubberized cement
  composite as a function of the influencing variables, a comprehensive comparative
  modeling was performed and different predictive models were developed using regressions
  and machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e. nonlinear multi-variable regression (NMVR),
  Artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy
  inference system (ANFIS), and support-vector machine (SVM). Closed- form formulations
  were derived for NMVR, ANN, and GP models, and parametric study was conducted for
  ML models. Performance criteria such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
  percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to compare
  the modelsâ€™ performance. It was found that SVM outperformed the other models with
  the highest R2 and the lowest RMSE equal to 0.989 and 1.393, respectively.

abstract: 'High-performance concrete (HPC) generally experiences rather high autogenous
  shrinkage. If restrained, residual tensile stress will be induced which may be sufficient
  to cause cracking. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) has been utilized
  as a mineral admixture to reduce shrinkage cracking in HPC. The restrained shrinkage
  cracking of concrete containing GGBFS appears to be less than that of concrete without
  slag. However, the data is limited, and the effect of the GGBFS on the restrained
  cracking resistance needs to be further investigated. Restrained ring tests on cracking
  resistance of HPC using GGBFS as 0%, 20%, 35%, and 50% by weight replacements of
  cement were performed. Four concrete mixtures with the same w/b ratio of 0.32 were
  placed in a 23 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH environment, and covered with vinyl and aluminum
  adhesive tape. The outer rings were removed at 24 h after casting to allow water
  evaporation through the height of the specimen. Test results showed that: (1) the
  residual tensile stress at the age of 14.25 days after casting decreased by 18.6%,
  33.2%, and 40.9% when the amount of GGBFS increased from 0% to 20%, 35%, and 50%,
  respectively; (2) the stress rate decreased by 58.9%, 62.5%, and 66.8% when the
  amount of GGBFS increased from 0% to 20%, 35%, and 50%, respectively, indicating
  that the cracking resistance based on stress rate increased with increasing GGBFS
  replacement.'

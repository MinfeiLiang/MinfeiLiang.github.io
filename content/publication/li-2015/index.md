abstract: The early-age volume deformation and cracking of sidewall concrete is the
  result of the concerted action of multi-factors containing chemical, hygral, thermal
  and mechanical changes. In this paper, a multi-field (hygro-thermo-chemo-mechanical)
  coupling model based on Fourier's law, Fick's law, mass and energy balance equations,
  was adopted to describe the cement hydration, temperature and humidity evolution
  for early-age sidewall concrete, and thermal, hygral deformations and cracking risk
  were obtained by further combining with shrinkage description for partially saturated
  porous solids and a widely used crack criterion. The effects of foundation constraint
  and early-age creep of concrete on deformation and cracking were also considered.
  Based on the multi-field coupling model, the cracking risk of sidewall concrete
  members with two typical concrete mixes before the removal of wooden formwork was
  evaluated in this paper, providing insight into the influence of parameters such
  as concrete mix and pouring lengths on the cracking risk of early-age concrete.

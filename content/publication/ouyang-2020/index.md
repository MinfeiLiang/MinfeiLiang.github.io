abstract: Scientific design of the composition of UHPC is important in achieving desired
  elastic modulus and prediction. In this paper, an analytical model based on composition
  through using a multi-scale model and homogenization method is proposed to analyze
  the effective elastic moduli of UHPC at micro-, meso-, and macro-scales. Volume
  fractions and elastic moduli of composed phases at various scales were used as inputs
  to estimate the corresponding elastic moduli at the upscale level. The model was
  first verified using measured elastic moduli of cement paste, mortar, and UHPC in
  literature. The effects of water-to-binder ratio (w/b), coarse aggregate content,
  and steel fiber shape on compressive strength and elastic modulus were then experimentally
  evaluated. Experimental results were in good agreement with the calculated results
  from the proposed model. Quantitatively analyses of the effects of key factors on
  elastic modulus of UHPC using the proposed model indicated that w/b was the most
  important factor, followed by coarse aggregate content, sand content, cement content,
  steel fiber volume, slag and silica fume content.

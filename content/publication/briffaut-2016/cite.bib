 abstract = {The cracking of concrete structures can drastically reduce their serviceability, specifically by inducing a decrease in bearing capacity while their permeability and diffusivity are being increased. Cracking therefore leads to a faster penetration of liquid, gaseous and aggressive agents, which may reduce the durability and the tightness of the structures. It may be caused by an external loading or else by the self- or external restraint of autogenous, drying and thermal shrinkage. This paper will focus on the latter of these phenomena. In the first part of this study (part I: Laboratory test), ring tests are performed to investigate the sensitivity of concrete to cracking due to both shrinkage strain and fibre type (two organic fibres and one steel fibre have been studied). Results obtained show that the use of polypropylene microfibres does not delay the age at which the first crack appears but does slightly reduce crack opening. Polypropylene and steel macrofibres have a greater effect since cracking is delayed and the crack opening is significantly reduced. Tensile strength results indicate that a portion of the cracking delay may be attributed to the tensile strength increase resulting from fibre reinforcement.},

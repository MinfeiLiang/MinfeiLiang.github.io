abstract: Fly ash and blast-furnace slag containing binders are frequently used in
  the construction industry and it is important to know the extent of autogenous shrinkage
  and its (ideal) mitigation by superabsorbent polymers in these systems as a function
  of their age. In this paper, the autogenous shrinkage was determined by manual and
  automated shrinkage measurements. Autogenous shrinkage was reduced in cement pastes
  with the supplementary cementitious materials versus Portland cement pastes. At
  later ages, the rate of autogenous shrinkage is higher due to the pozzolanic activity.
  Internal curing by means of superabsorbent polymers is successful, independent of
  this long term higher rate of shrinkage in mixtures with supplementary cementitious
  materials.

abstract: The morphology of outer-product (Op) C-S-H in 20-year-old slag-cement pastes
  appeared in most blends to be finer than at younger ages. The Ca/Si and Ca/(Si +
  Al) ratios of the Op C-S-H decreased with increasing slag content, and the Al/Si
  ratio increased. The Ca/Si ratio of C-S-H in the slag-containing pastes was lower
  at 20 years than at 14 months and the amount of Ca(OH)2 was reduced indicating that
  additional slag must have reacted. The mean aluminosilicate chain length of the
  C-S-H was very long in all the samples and would be expected to have increased with
  age. The TEM-EDX and NMR data are consistent with nanostructural models for C-S-H.
  The Mg/Al ratio of the Mg-Al layered double hydroxide phase (LDH) was lower at 20
  years than at 14 months in all cases except for the neat slag paste; aluminium hydroxide-based
  structure might be interstratified with those of the Mg-Al LDH. © 2010 Elsevier

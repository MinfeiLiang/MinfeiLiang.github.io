abstract: The aging aspect of basic creep of concrete can be mathematically handled
  by the solidification theory in which the material parameters for creep are considered
  to be age-independent but the volume fraction of the age-independent material increases
  with age. The solidification theory is formulated with a Kelvin chain model of infinite
  number of Kelvin units. The identification of this model from the measured creep
  curves of concrete and its conversion into a model with finite number of Kelvin
  units for numerical computations is shown.

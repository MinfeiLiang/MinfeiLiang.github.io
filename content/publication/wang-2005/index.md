abstract: <p>This paper presents the results of an investigation into the influence
  of fineness and particle size distribution of granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS)
  on its hydraulic reactivity in cement systems. The GBFS was separated into different
  fineness classes by grinding and/or air separation. The particle size distributions
  were determined by laser analysis and the specific surface by means of nitrogen
  adsorption Brunauer, Emmett and Taylor (BET) equation. The fineness affects the
  hydraulic reactivity of the GBFS considerably. In the case of a grain size. 20 &gt;m,
  the reactivity is greatly decreased. The fraction, 5 &lt;m plays an important role
  during hydration. For the development of the compressive strength of blast-furnace
  slag cement the fraction 20—0 μm is crucial. The contribution of the fraction with
  a grain size. 20 &gt;m in increasing the strength up to 7 days is of minor relevance.
  In order to obtain an effect on strength increasing up to 28 days the GBFS should
  be ground to, 40 &lt;m at least.</p>

abstract: In recent decades, several simulation models have been proposed to predict
  autogenous shrinkage of cementitious systems. In most of these models, however,
  only the elastic deformation caused by self-desiccation of the hydrating cement
  paste is considered. In fact, cement paste is not an ideal elastic material. Also
  the time-dependent deformation, i.e. creep, has been proposed an important component
  of autogenous shrinkage, especially at the early age. In this study, a simulation
  model for autogenous deformation is proposed, which includes an elastic part and
  a time-dependent part. The time-dependent part of this model is based on the activation
  energy concept. The capillary tension is considered as the driving force of the
  autogenous shrinkages. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction with
  the proposed model, CEM I and CEM III/B pastes are studied in this paper. The simulated
  autogenous shrinkages are compared with experimental results.

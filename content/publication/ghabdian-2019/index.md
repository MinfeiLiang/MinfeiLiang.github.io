abstract: A powerful and now theoretical approach is used to obtain an expression
  for the effect of creep on reinforced concrete shear deform able beams. First, a
  method is proposed for Ruler-Bernoulli beam to analyze the long-term behavior of
  concrete beams based on linear strain theory. Second, a formulation has been developed
  to analyze the strain distribution in shear deformablo concrete beams. Finally,
  three numerical examples are included in order to compare well-known codes with
  the proposed method. The comparison of the proposed method, FEM, codes, and experimental
  works demonstrates that the proposed analytical procedure can effectively simulate
  creep behavior of reinforced concrete beams.

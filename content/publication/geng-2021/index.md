abstract: <p>Concrete maturity theory has great potential in practical engineering.
  In this paper, the calculation and application of the concrete maturity are presented
  based on the qualitative analysis and quantitative calculations. Firstly, the maturity
  calculations are summarized by the methods of direct calculation and equivalent
  age calculation, as well as a theoretical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages
  of each calculation method. Secondly, the main methods of compressive strength and
  elastic modulus predicted by the concrete maturity are also summarized, and the
  calculation accuracy of the main calculation methods is compared with the published
  test results. Finally, based on actual engineering project, the research on concrete
  maturity is prospected to clarify the further research direction. The results show
  that the calculation methods of concrete maturity consist of direct calculation
  method and equivalent age calculation method, and the equivalent age calculation
  method is more reasonable in theory. Considering the wide range of construction
  temperature, the Freiesleben-Hansen equivalent age equation and exponential function
  prediction equation are recommended to predict the strength and elastic modulus
  of concrete.</p>

abstract: This study aims to implement a hybrid ensemble surrogate machine learning
  technique in predicting the compressive strength (CS) of concrete, an important
  parameter used for durability design and service life prediction of concrete structures
  in civil engineering projects. For this purpose, an experimental database consisting
  of 1030 records has been compiled from the machine learning repository of the University
  of California, Irvine. The database was used to train and validate four conventional
  machine learning (CML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear and
  Non-Linear Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS-L and MARS-C), Gaussian
  Process Regression (GPR), and Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR). Subsequently,
  the predicted outputs of CML models were combined and trained using ANN to construct
  the Hybrid Ensemble Model (HENSM). It is observed that the proposed HENSM produces
  higher predictive accuracy compared to the CML models used in the present study.
  The predictive performance of all models for CS prediction was compared using the
  testing dataset and it is found that the HENSM model attained the highest predictive
  accuracy in both phases. Based on the experimental results, the newly constructed
  HENSM model is very potential to be a new alternative in handling the overfitting
  issues of CML models and hence, can be used to predict the concrete CS, including
  the design of less polluting and more sustainable concrete constructions.

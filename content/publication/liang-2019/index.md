abstract: The shrinkage of concrete when exposed to external drying influences the
  accurate quantification of concrete creep. To reduce the effect of shrinkage on
  the measured creep, particularly for concrete at early ages when the shrinkage is
  pronounced, a flexural creep test set-up was designed in this study to investigate
  the creep property of concrete beams with w/c ratios of 0.3 and 0.4 at the age of
  7 days. The concrete beams were exposed to both sealed and drying conditions. A
  sequential coupled hydromechanical finite element analysis was conducted to back-calculate
  the creep parameters in the original microprestress solidification theory-based
  creep model from the measured creep-induced deflection. The results show that the
  flexural creep test is capable of obtaining the intrinsic creep property of concrete
  without incorporating the shrinkage effect as long as the relative humidity distribution
  in the concrete beams is symmetric about the neutral plane. The intrinsic creep
  property depends only on the mixture proportions of concrete, i.e., it is independent
  of the loading and drying conditions, which can be used to predict the deflection
  development of concrete beam under other complex drying conditions. The findings
  in this study provide a new methodology of obtaining concrete creep, which solves
  the problem of the conventional uniaxial creep testing method that both creep strain
  and shrinkage strain need to be measured during the creep test.

abstract: The term “Time-zero”, i.e., the time for the start of autogenous shrinkage
  measurement, is usually used for estimating the cracking potential of structural
  components. Accurate determination of the “time-zero” is therefore critical for
  autogenous shrinkage measurement, which is the main objective of this study. There
  is a general agreement about the existence of a relationship between autogenous
  shrinkage and RH changes in hardening cement paste. An improved hygrometer method
  was developed for monitoring the change of internal RH in cement pastes 1 h after
  casting. This provides immediate experimental results of RH change for determining
  the “time-zero”. It indicates that the internal RH of cement pastes does not decrease
  immediately after the final setting time. A new “time-zero” is defined as the onset
  of internal RH drop, which is more reasonable for estimating the cracking potential
  of cement-based materials, compared to the “time-zero” represented by the final
  setting time.

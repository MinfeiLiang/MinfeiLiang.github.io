abstract: Shrinkage tests have been performed on blended Portland cement based early-age
  concrete with different w/c ratios, undergoing variable temperature curing. Results
  showed presence of induced non-negligible autogenous swelling which could mitigate
  part of the stresses related to shrinkage at very young concrete age. Recorded swelling
  was higher at higher curing temperatures and longer duration, especially pronounced
  for the low w/c mix. The swelling continued for several days after the temperature
  stabilized. Although not investigated directly, evidence to the nonlinear nature
  of the thermal expansion coefficient in young concrete has also been provided.

abstract: 'Cementitious materials represent the most used materials in the construction
  industry. Their strong heterogeneity and multiscale microstructure make the study
  of the mechanical properties and the in-service behaviour very challenging: new
  techniques are required by industrial research to better investigate these aspects.
  In this work a novel technique based on statistical nanoindentation is exploited
  to obtain results about the microstructure build-up and the mechanical properties.
  An innovative high-speed nanoindentation method is here combined and compared with
  a standard nanoindentation procedure in order to get highly consistent statistical
  results. Combining the high-speed nanoindentation, the statistical deconvolution
  and SEM/EDS investigations, the main phases present in the tested hydrated cement
  paste have been characterized. High-resolution maps of the mechanical properties
  are in good agreement with SEM-EDS results. The evolution of the mechanical properties
  has been tested over the time and in particular after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days
  of hydration. It was found that the nano-mechanical properties were almost constant
  during the hydration time and the evolution of the bulk mechanical resistance properties
  of the cement paste is found to be due to a variation of the volume proportions
  between the three principal phases (low-density, high-density and ultra-high-density
  C-S-H).'

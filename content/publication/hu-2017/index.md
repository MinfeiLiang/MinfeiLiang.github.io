abstract: To investigate the micro-mechanical properties of calcium sulfoaluminate
  cement and the correlation with the microstructures, we apply a variety of advanced
  techniques of microstructural and micro-mechanical characterization, including scanning
  electron microscopy with backscattered electron and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
  detectors, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation. For the first
  time, the micro-mechanical properties of material microstructures present in a calcium
  sulfoaluminate cement are estimated. In the calcium sulfoaluminate cement used in
  this research, two type of hydration product microstructures with the differentiable
  microstructural morphologies, compositions and micro-mechanical properties are identified
  and investigated. The correlation of the micro-mechanical properties with the microstructures
  shows that the hydration product microstructure containing more ettringite has lower
  indentation modulus and hardness than that containing more aluminum hydroxide.

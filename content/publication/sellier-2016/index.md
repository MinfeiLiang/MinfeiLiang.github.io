abstract: Concrete creep models have to consider several important phenomena (non-linearity,
  multi-axiality, hydration, and thermal and drying effects) to be relevant in structural
  applications. A selection of experimental results of creep tests found in the scientific
  literature are used to highlight these phenomena. Firstly, regarding the creep rate
  in different directions of a specimen under various loads, it is shown that creep
  rate under moderate loading can derive from elastic strains. Secondly, the reason
  why a Drucker Prager criterion can be chosen to model non-linear creep is discussed.
  Thirdly the interest of resorting to a creep theory able to decouple ageing (or
  hydration) effects and consolidation effects is explained. Moreover, interest using
  a poro-mechanical formulation, in which Biot coefficient depends on stress state,
  to model drying creep and shrinkage is discussed in the light of short meso-scopic
  analysis. The effect of temperature on creep is also addressed. The numerical implementation
  of the proposed modelling is briefly exposed and the model responses are confronted
  with experimental results.

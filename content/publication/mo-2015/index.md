abstract: This paper presents a study on the use of high volume slag as a cement replacement
  material, and waste oil palm shell (OPS) as a lightweight aggregate to produce a
  sustainable lightweight concrete (LWC). In order to establish the feasibility of
  such concrete for structural purposes, the first part of the paper deals with the
  investigation of the mechanical and bond properties of OPS concrete (OPSC) with
  varying slag content. The results showed that even though an increase in the slag
  content led to the reduction in the strength, the OPSC with slag as a 60% cement
  replacement material exhibited compressive and splitting tensile strengths of 25
  and 2.3 MPa, respectively, which exceeded the minimum stipulated strength required
  for structural LWC. In addition, the use of 60% slag in OPSC showed significant
  benefits in terms of the reduced cement consumption with improvement in the strength
  efficiency by almost 2-fold compared to that without slag. On the other hand, it
  was found that the slag content, albeit as high as a 60% cement replacement level,
  did not show any significant adverse effects on the normalized bond strength, failure
  mode, bond strength-slip curve and slip at the ultimate bond strength of the OPSC.
  To further justify the suitability of the OSPC for structural application, the second
  part of the paper focuses on the experimental investigation of the flexural behaviour
  of the actual full-scale reinforced concrete beams. From the flexural tests, it
  was observed that there were no negative effects on the ultimate moment capacity,
  failure mode and moment-deflection behaviour of the reinforced concrete beams upon
  cement replacement with up to 60% slag. Therefore, the utilization of high volume
  slag-lightweight OPSC could be recommended for actual structural purposes.

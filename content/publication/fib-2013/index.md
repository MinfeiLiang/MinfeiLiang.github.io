abstract: "The International Federation for Structural Concrete (fib) is a pre-normative
  organization. 'Pre-normative' implies pioneering work in codification. This work
  has now been realized with the fib Model Code 2010. The objectives of the fib Model
  Code 2010 are to serve as a basis for future codes for concrete structures, and
  present new developments with regard to concrete structures, structural materials
  and new ideas in order to achieve optimum behaviour. The fib Model Code 2010 is
  now the most comprehensive code on concrete structures, including their complete
  life cycle: conceptual design, dimensioning, construction, conservation and dismantlement.
  It is expected to become an important document for both national and international
  code committees, practitioners and researchers. The fib Model Code 2010 was produced
  during the last ten years through an exceptional effort by Joost Walraven (Convener;
  Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands), Agnieszka Bigaj-van Vliet (Technical
  Secretary; TNO Built Environment and Geosciences, The Netherlands) as well as experts
  out of 44 countries from five continents."

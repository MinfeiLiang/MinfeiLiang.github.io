abstract: The paper is focused on the reliability of existing guidelines for both
  the design and evaluation of early-age cracking risk in concrete structures. The
  study considers the recommendations for reinforced concrete tank walls and bridge
  abutments, which are especially prone to early-age cracking. A thorough review and
  discussion of the American, European and Japanese guidelines are supplemented by
  the analytical procedure for simple evaluation of thermal loads and more precisely
  considering shrinkage strains. The results obtained using the guidelines were compared
  with actual observations of crack width in tank walls and bridge abutments. An example
  of using standards in wall design is also presented. Finally, the usefulness of
  the presented methods is highlighted with suggestions for a possible path for considering
  early-age thermal and shrinkage effects in reinforced concrete wall structures.

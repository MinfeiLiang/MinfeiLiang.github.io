abstract: Effects of rate of pressure application and forms and type of sample on
  porosity and pore size distribution of concrete estimated through mercury intrusion
  porosimetry (MIP) are presented in this experimental work. Two different forms of
  concrete sample, namely, crushed chunks of concrete and small core drilled out from
  the concrete beam specimens, were used for this study. The results exhibit that
  the rate of pressure application in mercury porosimetry has little effect on porosity
  and pore size distribution of concrete. It is also demonstrated that small cores
  drilled out from large concrete specimens are preferable as samples for performing
  porosimetry test on concrete. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

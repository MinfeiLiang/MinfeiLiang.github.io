abstract: Proper knowledge of tensile properties of concrete from very early ages
  is essential for effective control of not only early-age cracking but also of residual
  stress due to restrained early-age deformation as well as for demolding and handling
  of young concrete members in the precast industry. Despite significant past research,
  such knowledge is currently inadequate and based on experimental data with questionable
  reliability, due mainly to the considerable challenges in testing early-age concrete.
  This paper first highlights the challenge and importance of collecting reliable
  test data on full tensile stress-deformation curves for very early-age concrete.
  Through identifying and effectively addressing critical drawbacks in previous test
  setups, an improved direct tensile testing system that can reliably capture simultaneously
  stress and deformation of concrete from the age of several hours after mixing has
  been successfully developed. Key features of the improved setup, including the air-bearing
  box for friction minimisation and digital image correlation for non-contact full-field
  deformation capturing, are then reported in the paper. Based on the newly collected
  data, fundamental tensile properties of concrete at very early ages are re-assessed
  and presented. Such properties include tensile strength, Young's modulus, strain
  at peak stress, fracture energy, performance under cyclic loading and tensile relaxation.

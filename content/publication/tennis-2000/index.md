abstract: A new physical basis for a previously published model for the structure
  of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) as measured by nitrogen sorption is described.
  This refined model provides a method of predicting the density, the nitrogen accessible
  gel porosity, and associated surface area of C-S-H in Portland cement pastes. The
  basis for the model is that C-S-H forms as one of two types, high- or low-density
  C-S-H. This provides a promising tool for characterizing the microstructure in a
  way that can be applied to understanding properties of engineering significance.

abstract: During the process of setting and hardening in concrete, the temperature
  profile shows a gradual nonlinear distribution due to the development of heat of
  hydration in cement. At early ages of concrete structures, this nonlinear distribution
  can have a large influence on crack evolution. It is thus important to obtain an
  accurate temperature history, and to do this, it is necessary to examine the thermal
  properties of the concrete. In this study, the convective heat transfer coefficient,
  which represents the heat transfer between a concrete surface and ambient air, was
  experimentally investigated with test variables such as the velocity of wind, the
  curing conditions, and the ambient temperature. For analyses using the thermal equilibrium
  boundary condition, it is generally noted that most of the heat release by the evaporation
  of moisture occurs at an early stage. To consider this phenomenon, the existing
  thermal equilibrium boundary condition has been modified so as to consider the evaporation
  quantity due to the evaporation effect. Convective heat transfer coefficients for
  a specific case were then calculated from the modified thermal equilibrium boundary
  condition using experimental results. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

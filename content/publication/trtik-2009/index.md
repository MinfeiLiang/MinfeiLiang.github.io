abstract: 'Recent results of statistical nanoindentation testing on hardened cement
  pastes (HCP) reported in the literature show a multipeak response in the elastic
  modulus frequency plots. These peaks have been interpreted as indicating the true
  elastic modulus of two calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) phases of different densities.
  However, the application of statistical indentation for determining material properties
  of single phases in HCP appears to violate some of the basic principles of the technique.
  To elucidate this aspect, virtual experiments emulating statistical nanoindentation
  are performed and presented in this paper. They are based on 3D images of: (i) an
  idealized two-phase material and (ii) HCP acquired by focussed ion beam nanotomography
  (FIB-nt); within both 3D images, a marching object is sampled over a large number
  of positions. Based on the local phase composition within the marching object, a
  local stiffness is estimated by using simple composite models. Due to the large
  number of the investigated positions, the elastic modulus can be statistically evaluated
  in the same manner as in the real statistical indentation experiments. The results
  presented in this paper indicate that the homogenous C-S-H regions present in HCP
  are too small to cause independent and separated peaks in the elastic modulus plots.
  Moreover, the presence of phases other than C-S-H, namely unhydrated cement and
  calcium hydroxide, may also produce spurious peaks in the frequency plots. In conclusion,
  the presented results question the notion that the multipeak signature in statistical
  nanoindentation experiments on HCP can be explained only by the presence of two
  distinct C-S-H phases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'

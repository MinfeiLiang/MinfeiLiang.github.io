abstract: In this study, an efficient implementation of machine learning models to
  predict compressive and tensile strengths of high-performance concrete (HPC) is
  presented. Four predictive algorithms including support vector regression (SVR),
  multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting regressor (GBR), and extreme gradient
  boosting (XGBoost) are employed. The process of hyperparameter tuning is based on
  random search that results in trained models with better predictive performances.
  In addition, the missing data is handled by filling with the mean of the available
  data which allows more information to be used in the training process. The results
  on two popular datasets of compressive and tensile strengths of high performance
  concrete show significant improvement of the current approach in terms of both prediction
  accuracy and computational effort. The comparative studies reveal that, for this
  particular prediction problem, the trained models based on GBR and XGBoost perform
  better than those of SVR and MLP.

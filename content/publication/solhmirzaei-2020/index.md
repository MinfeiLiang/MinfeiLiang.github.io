abstract: This paper presents a data-driven machine learning (ML) framework for predicting
  failure mode and shear capacity of Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) beams.
  To this end, a comprehensive database on 360 reported tests on UHPC beams with different
  geometric, fiber properties, loading and material characteristics was collected.
  This database was then analyzed utilizing different ML algorithms including, support
  vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN),
  and genetic programing (GP), to identify key parameters governing failure pattern
  and shear capacity of UHPC beams. The outcome of this analysis is a computational-based
  ML framework that is capable of identifying failure mode of UHPC beams and simplified
  expressions for predicting shear capacity of UHPC beams. Predictions obtained from
  the proposed framework was compared against the values obtained from design equations
  in codes, and also results from full-scale tests to show the reliability of the
  proposed approach. The results clearly infer that the proposed data-driven ML framework
  can effectively predict failure mode and shear capacity of prestressed and non-prestressed
  UHPC beams with varying reinforcement detailing and configurations.

abstract: Prestress losses due to creep of concrete is a matter of interest for long-term
  operations of nuclear power plants containment buildings. Experimental studies by
  Granger (1995) have shown that concretes with similar formulations have different
  creep behaviors. The aim of this paper is to numerically investigate the effect
  of size distribution and shape of elastic inclusions on the long-term creep of concrete.
  Several microstructures with prescribed size distribution and spherical or polyhedral
  shape of inclusions are generated. By using the 3D numerical homogenization procedure
  for viscoelastic microstructures proposed by Šmilauer and Bažant (2010), it is shown
  that the size distribution and shape of inclusions have no measurable influence
  on the overall creep behavior. Moreover, a mean-field estimate provides close predictions.
  An Interfacial Transition Zone was introduced according to the model of Nadeau (2003).
  It is shown that this feature of concrete's microstructure can explain differences
  between creep behaviors.

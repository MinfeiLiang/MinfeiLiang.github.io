abstract: A series of conventional and high-performance concretes, with and without
  silica fume additions, have been prepared and characterized with respect to their
  adiabatic heat signature. The measured responses are compared with predicted values
  from the NIST 3-D cement hydration and microstructural model, which has been modified
  to incorporate the pozzolanic reaction of silica fume and to simulate hydration
  under adiabatic conditions. The latter modification is based on the activation energies
  and heats of reaction for the hydration and pozzolanic reactions and the heat capacity
  of the hydrating concrete mixture. For concretes with and without silica fume, the
  agreement between predicted and measured response is always within about five degrees
  Celsius. For concretes with silica fume, using an appropriate stoichiometry for
  the pozzolanic C-S-H is critical in matching the long-term (4 to 8 day) experimental
  temperature rise behavior. Â© 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

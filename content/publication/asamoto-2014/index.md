abstract: The authors investigated a technique to inhibit subsequent prestress loss
  in a concrete beam by effective creep induction at an early age, and examined the
  structural performances of beams with the creep at an early age. Consistent experimental
  results suggested that a more progressive creep induced by a higher first prestressing
  force or under an elevated temperature (45 °C) at an early age was likely to reduce
  the prestress loss after another prestressing at seven days of age. The creep tended
  to increase the compressive strength and Young's modulus of the concrete, and the
  tensile strength was not decreased when the sustained stress was within the elastic
  range. The flexural behaviour of a prestressed concrete beam with the creep at an
  early age was observed to be almost the same as that of a beam without the creep,
  although the maximum flexural crack width was slightly increased by the early age
  creep. It was found that the shear crack propagation was more progressive when the
  creep was significantly accelerated at an early age under severe conditions that
  applied a high sustained stress beyond the elastic range or at the elevated temperature.
  It was thus concluded that a larger creep induction at an early age impeded subsequent
  prestress loss in concrete beams more significantly, although its acceleration under
  the above severe conditions may lead to reduction of the structural performance.

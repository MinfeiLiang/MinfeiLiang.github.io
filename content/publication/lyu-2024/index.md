abstract: <p>Microstructure reconstruction serves as a crucial foundation for establishing
  process–structure–property (PSP) relationship in material design. Confronting the
  limitations of variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network within
  generative models, this study adopted the denoising diffusion probabilistic model
  (DDPM) to learn the probability distribution of high-dimensional raw data and successfully
  reconstructed the microstructures of various composite materials, such as inclusion
  materials, spinodal decomposition materials, chessboard materials, fractal noise
  materials, and so on. The quality of generated microstructure was evaluated using
  quantitative measures like spatial correlation functions and Fourier descriptor.
  On this basis, this study also achieved the regulation of microstructure randomness
  and the generation of gradient materials through continuous interpolation in latent
  space using denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM). Furthermore, the two-dimensional
  microstructure reconstruction was extended to three-dimensional framework and integrated
  permeability as a feature encoding embedding. This enables the conditional generation
  of three-dimensional microstructures for random porous materials within a defined
  permeability range. The permeabilities of these generated microstructures were further
  validated through the application of the lattice Boltzmann method. The above methods
  provide new ideas and references for material reverse design.</p>

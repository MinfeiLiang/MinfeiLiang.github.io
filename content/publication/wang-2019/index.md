abstract: A new relaxation function and a new age-adjusted effective modulus expression
  of concrete are derived by applying the integral mean value theorem in mathematics
  to the integral equation of creep analysis. Expressions of the age adjusting coefficient
  used for prediction of relaxation function and age-adjusted effective modulus in
  the derived expressions are presented based on the creep models in the fib Model
  Code 2010 and ACI 209 2R-08 report. It is indicated that the results of relaxation
  function and age-adjusted effective modulus predicted by the derived expressions
  are in good agreement with those computed by the step by step method. Because the
  age-adjusted effective modulus is insensitive to the variation of the age adjusting
  coefficient, thus simplified equations for calculation of age adjusting coefficient
  are also established. An example of a two-span bridge is presented to show the application
  of the proposed age-adjusted effective modulus for moment redistribution analysis.

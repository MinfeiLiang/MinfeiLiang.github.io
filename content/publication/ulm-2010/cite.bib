 abstract = {In their paper, Trtik et al. (2009) identify spurious peaks in the application of statistical nanoindentation technique as a critical obstacle for mechanical phase identification. In this discussion, we show that Trtik et al.'s finding is a consequence of an unrealistic virtual 3-D checkerboard microstructure considered by the authors. These peaks are not a general feature of indentation on multiphase materials, nor can the presence of such peaks be attributed to an intrinsic shortcoming of the grid-indentation technique. We also show that the authors' assertion of the absence of homogeneous material regions extending beyond 3 μm in cementitious materials is groundless. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

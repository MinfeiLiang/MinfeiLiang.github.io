abstract: In their paper, Trtik et al. (2009) identify spurious peaks in the application
  of statistical nanoindentation technique as a critical obstacle for mechanical phase
  identification. In this discussion, we show that Trtik et al.'s finding is a consequence
  of an unrealistic virtual 3-D checkerboard microstructure considered by the authors.
  These peaks are not a general feature of indentation on multiphase materials, nor
  can the presence of such peaks be attributed to an intrinsic shortcoming of the
  grid-indentation technique. We also show that the authors' assertion of the absence
  of homogeneous material regions extending beyond 3 μm in cementitious materials
  is groundless. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract: The first large worldwide database of creep and shrinkage tests was assembled
  at Northwestern University (NU) in 1978. It was expanded as the RILEM database in
  1992 and further in 2008. A major expansion, completely restructured and verified,
  named the NU Database, is now presented. The number of the test curves of creep
  and drying shrinkage is more than doubled and over 400 test curves of autogenous
  shrinkage are added. The database covers longer measurement periods and encompasses
  the effects of admixtures in modern concrete mixtures. The database contains roughly
  1400 creep and 1800 shrinkage curves, of which approximately 800 creep and 1050
  shrinkage curves contain admixtures. Their analysis shows significant influence
  of admixtures on the creep and shrinkage behavior. The mixture proportions, testing
  conditions, and specimen geometries are documented in greater detail, and information
  on the admixture contents and aggregate types is included. The new database makes
  it possible to calibrate and verify improved creep and shrinkage prediction models.
  Additionally, the statistics of the mixture parameters, strength distributions,
  and scatter of the compliance curves have been extracted for applications in reliability
  engineering and probabilistic performance assessment. Data analysis brings to light
  various recommendations for testing and recording, and suggests corrections of various
  oversights distorting the reported data. These recommendations would make future
  test data more useful, consistent, complete, and reliable. The NU database is now
  available for free download at www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/ as well
  as at www.baunat.boku.ac.at/creep.html.

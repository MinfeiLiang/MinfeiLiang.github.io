abstract: 'Non-uniform stresses, strains and microcracking of the concretes with three
  coarse aggregate sizes (5–10 mm, 10–16 mm, 16–20 mm) dried under 40% relative humidity
  (RH) for 60 days were quantified using digital image correlation and lattice fracture
  modelling. The influencing mechanism of coarse aggregate size on the drying-induced
  microcracking of concrete was clarified: (1) As the coarse aggregate size decreases,
  propagation paths of microcracking are increased, which increase the number of small
  microcracks and release the drying shrinkage force from mortar phase. (2) Tensile
  stress shells surrounding the coarse aggregates become thinner, thereby decreasing
  the area of large microcracks. As the coarse aggregate size decreased from 16-20
  mm to 5–10 mm, the average thickness of tensile stress shells decreased from 2.13
  mm to 1.09 mm at the beginning of drying, and the area of the microcracks >5 μm
  in width decreased from 796.6 mm2/m2 to 340.2 mm2/m2 at 60 days since drying.'

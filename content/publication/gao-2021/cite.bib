 abstract = {Non-uniform stresses, strains and microcracking of the concretes with three coarse aggregate sizes (5–10 mm, 10–16 mm, 16–20 mm) dried under 40% relative humidity (RH) for 60 days were quantified using digital image correlation and lattice fracture modelling. The influencing mechanism of coarse aggregate size on the drying-induced microcracking of concrete was clarified: (1) As the coarse aggregate size decreases, propagation paths of microcracking are increased, which increase the number of small microcracks and release the drying shrinkage force from mortar phase. (2) Tensile stress shells surrounding the coarse aggregates become thinner, thereby decreasing the area of large microcracks. As the coarse aggregate size decreased from 16-20 mm to 5–10 mm, the average thickness of tensile stress shells decreased from 2.13 mm to 1.09 mm at the beginning of drying, and the area of the microcracks >5 μm in width decreased from 796.6 mm2/m2 to 340.2 mm2/m2 at 60 days since drying.},

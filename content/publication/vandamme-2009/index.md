abstract: "Concrete, the solid that forms at room temperature from mixing Portland
  cement with water, sand, and aggregates, suffers from time-dependent deformation
  under load. This creep occurs at a rate that deteriorates the durability and truncates
  the lifespan of concrete structures. However, despite decades of research, the origin
  of concrete creep remains unknown. Here, we measure the in situ creep behavior of
  calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H), the nano-meter sized particles that form the
  fundamental building block of Portland cement concrete. We show that C-S-H exhibits
  a logarithmic creep that depends only on the packing of 3 structurally distinct
  but compositionally similar C-S-H forms: low density, high density, ultra-high density.
  We demonstrate that the creep rate (1/t) is likely due to the rearrangement of nanoscale
  particles around limit packing densities following the free-volume dynamics theory
  of granular physics. These findings could lead to a new basis for nanoengineering
  concrete materials and structures with minimal creep rates monitored by packing
  density distributions of nanoscale particles, and predicted by nanoscale creep measurements
  in some minute time, which are as exact as macroscopic creep tests carried out over
  years. C oncrete is the most-used construction material on earth. The annual worldwide
  production stands at 20 billion tons and increases per annum by 5%. However, the
  fundamental causes of concrete creep are still an enigma, and have deceived many
  decoding attempts from both experimental (1-3) and theoretical sides (4-8). In the
  United States alone, concrete creep is partly responsible for an estimated 78.8
  billion dollars required annually for highway and bridge maintenance. Although it
  is generally agreed that the complex creep behavior of concrete materials is largely
  related to the viscoelastic response of the primary hydration product and binding
  phase of hardened Portland cement paste, the calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the
  creep properties of C-S-H have never been measured directly. C-S-H precipitates
  when cement and water are mixed, as clusters of nanoscale colloidal particles (9,
  10) that cannot be recapitulated ex situ in bulk form suitable for macroscopic testing.
  Over decades, therefore, concrete creep properties have been probed on the composite
  scale of mortar and concrete (11), with the conclusion that there are 2 distinct
  creep phenomena at play (Fig. 1 A and B): a short-term volumetric creep and a long-term
  creep associated with shear deformation (3, 7, 12, 13), with a creep rate evolving
  as a power function t n of exponent n between 0.9 and 1 (14). The assessment of
  this long-term creep is most critical for the durability of concrete structures,
  and requires, for a specific concrete composition and structural application, years
  of expensive macroscopic testing (11, 14). After more than 40 years of research
  (4-8), basic questions persist regarding the physical origin of this logarithmic
  creep and its link with microstructure and composition. In this study, we investigate
  the creep properties of C-S-H. This is achieved by means of a statistical nanoindentation
  technique (SNT), described and validated previously (15-17), which is most suitable
  for the in situ investigation of mechanical phase properties and microstructure
  of highly heterogeneous hydrated composite materials. Like the classical indentation
  technique, an indenter tip (here a 3-sided pyramid Berkovich tip) is pushed orthogonally
  to the surface of the cement paste, and both the load applied to the tip, and the
  displacement of the tip with respect to the surface are recorded. By applying continuum-based
  constitutive models to the resulting load-displacement curve, mechanical properties
  of the indented material are determined. Applied to heterogeneous and mul-tiphase
  materials, the SNT then consists of carrying out a large array of such nanoindentation
  tests, and by applying statistical deconvolution techniques (15, 16) and micromechanical
  models to link microstructure to phase properties (17-19). Results Nine cement pastes
  of different compositions representative of a large range of real Portland concretes,
  were tested. They differed by their water-to-cement (w/c) mass ratio ranging from
  w/c 0.15 to w/c 0.40, heat treatment, and mineral additions, including silica fumes
  and calcareous fillers. The samples were prepared according to a procedure described
  in a previous study (20). On each sample 2 series of statistical nanoindentation
  tests were carried out that differ in the loading protocol: the first series assesses
  the microstructure from indentation hardness and indentation stiffness results;
  obtained by a trapezoidal load history with a maximum load of P max 2 mN, applied
  in 10 s, kept constant over 5 s and unloaded in 10 s. Following fast loading, the
  5-s dwelling time is short enough to ensure that the indentation hardness, H P max
  /A c (with A c the projected area of contact between the indenter probe and the
  indented surface), is representative of the strength content (19, 23, 24). In turn,
  the unloading is fast enough so that the indentation modulus M, determined from
  the unloading slope S (dP/ dh) hh max at the end of the holding phase truly relates
  to the elasticity content of the indented material (25), namely the indentation
  modulus M E/(1 2) S/(2a U), with E the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and
  a U A c / the radius of contact between the indenter probe and the indented surface
  upon unloading (21, 22, 26). The load protocol of the second series differs from
  the first in a 180-s long dwelling period, which allows the assessment of the contact
  creep compliance rate, L ˙ (t) 2a U h ˙ h/P max , and the creep compliance, L(t)
  2a U h(t)/P max const, from the time-dependent indentation depth rate h ˙ (t) and
  the change in indentation depth h(t) h(t) h 0 in excess of the indentation depth
  h 0 200 nm 45 nm recorded during the 10-s loading to P max 2 mN (Fig. 1C). In each
  series on the 9 samples, 400 nanoindentation tests were performed, of which on-average
  282 indentations were identified as indents on C-S-H phases, recognized by an indentation
  modulus and hardness smaller than the C-S-H particle stiffness and hardness, M m
  s 63.5 GPa and H h s 3 GPa, determined in previous studies (16, 17, 27). In all
  tests on C-S-H phases, after correcting for thermal drift effects of the indenter
  equipment, a least square fitting of h(t) h(t) h 0 demonstrates an indentation creep
  compliance of the C-S-H phases that is logarithmic with regard to time (Fig."

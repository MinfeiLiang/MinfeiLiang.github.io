abstract: Cracking is a common problem in concrete structures in real-life service
  conditions. In fact, crack-free concrete structures are very rare to find in real
  world. Concrete can undergo early-age cracking depending on the mix composition,
  exposure environment, hydration rate, and curing conditions. Understanding the causes
  and consequences of cracking thoroughly is essential for selecting proper measures
  to resolve the early-age cracking problem in concrete. This paper will help to identify
  the major causes and consequences of the early-age cracking in concrete. Also, this
  paper will be useful to adopt effective remedial measures for reducing or eliminating
  the early-age cracking problem in concrete. Different types of early-age crack,
  the factors affecting the initiation and growth of early-age cracks, the causes
  of early-age cracking, and the modeling of early-age cracking are discussed in this
  paper. A number of examples for various early-age cracking problems of concrete
  found in different structural elements are also shown. Above all, some recommendations
  are given for minimizing the early-age cracking in concrete. It is hoped that the
  information conveyed in this paper will be beneficial to improve the service life
  of concrete structures. Concrete researchers and practitioners may benefit from
  the contents of this paper.

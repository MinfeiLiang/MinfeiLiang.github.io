abstract: For concrete subjected to restrained conditions, autogenous deformation
  (AD) and thermal dilation (TD) are the main driving forces behind stress development
  in the hardening phase. Generally, AD in concrete is modelled by model codes or
  measured in the laboratory under 20 °C isothermal conditions, and then used as basis
  for stress calculations under realistic temperature conditions. To evaluate this
  common simplification, the current study investigated the effect of curing temperature
  on the AD of a series of fly ash concretes. A comprehensive test program was performed
  for fly ash concretes subjected to various temperature curing conditions. The model
  codes and measurements under 20 °C isothermal conditions provided AD developments
  in the same order of magnitude. However, when subjected to a realistic temperature
  history during curing, major changes in the AD developments were observed, emphasising
  that AD must be determined under relevant temperature conditions.

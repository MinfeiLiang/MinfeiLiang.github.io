abstract: The kriging-based genetic algorithm is applied to aerodynamic design problems.
  The kriging model is a response surface model that represents a relationship between
  objective function (output) and design variables (input) using a stochastic process.
  The kriging model drastically reduces the computational time required for objective
  function evaluation in the optimization (optimum searching) process. Expected improvement
  is used as a criterion to select additional sample points. This makes it possible
  not only to improve the accuracy of the response surface, but also to explore the
  global optimum efficiently. The functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted
  to evaluate the influence of each design variable and their interactions to the
  objective function. Based on the result of the functional ANOVA, designers can reduce
  the number of design variables by eliminating those that have small effect on the
  objective function. The present method is applied to a two-dimensional airfoil design
  and the prediction of flap's position in a multi-element airfoil, where the lift-to-drag
  ratio (L/D) is maximized. Copyright Â© 2004 by the American Institute of Aeronautics

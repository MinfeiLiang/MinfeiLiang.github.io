abstract: This paper is concerned with the development of a computational algorithm
  for the solution of the uncoupled, quasi-static boundary value problem for a linear
  viscoelastic solid undergoing thermal and mechanical deformation. The method evolves
  from a finite element discretization of a stationary value problem, leading to the
  solution of a system of linear integral equations determining the motion of the
  solid. An illustrative example is included.

abstract: In the present paper we argue that the cement and concrete industry is contributing
  positively to the Climate Change Initiative by:* Continuously reducing the CO2 emission
  from cement production by increased use of bio-fuels and alternative raw materials
  as well as introducing modified low-energy clinker types and cements with reduced
  clinker content.* Developing concrete compositions with the lowest possible environmental
  impact by selecting the cement type, the type and dosage of supplementary cementitious
  materials and the concrete quality to best suit the use in question.* Exploiting
  the potential of concrete recycling to increase the rate of CO2 uptake.* Exploiting
  the thermal mass of concrete to create energy-optimized solutions for heating and
  cooling residential and office buildings. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract: <p>Computer vision has been studied from many persective. It expands from
  raw data recording into techniques and ideas combining digital image processing,
  pattern recognition, machine learning and computer graphics. The wide usage has
  attracted many scholars to integrate with many disciplines and fields. This paper
  provide a survey of the recent technologies and theoretical concept explaining the
  development of computer vision especially related to image processing using different
  areas of their field application. Computer vision helps scholars to analyze images
  and video to obtain necessary information,    understand information on events or
  descriptions, and scenic pattern. It used method of multi-range application domain
  with massive data analysis. This paper provides contribution of recent development
  on reviews related to computer vision, image processing, and their related studies.
  We categorized the computer vision mainstream into four group e.g., image processing,
  object recognition, and machine learning. We also provide brief explanation on the
  up-to-date information about the techniques and their performance.</p>

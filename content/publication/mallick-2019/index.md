abstract: In the present study, microindentation tests are carried out to investigate
  the creep of cement paste at early ages and beyond, up to 90 days. The effect of
  capillary water on the creep of cement paste is studied by carrying out microindentation
  tests on samples with and without drying. The results of the microindentation studies
  have been analysed by plotting the discrete retardation spectra (DRS). DRS for SC
  and DC specimens distinctly show the presence of two short-term creep mechanisms,
  one occurring around 0.6â€“1.0 s, and another occurring around 10 s, and a long-term
  creep mechanism occurring much beyond 10 s. The results indicate that presence of
  capillary water seems to have a significant influence on creep compliance of cement
  paste loaded at early ages.

 abstract = {In the present study, microindentation tests are carried out to investigate the creep of cement paste at early ages and beyond, up to 90 days. The effect of capillary water on the creep of cement paste is studied by carrying out microindentation tests on samples with and without drying. The results of the microindentation studies have been analysed by plotting the discrete retardation spectra (DRS). DRS for SC and DC specimens distinctly show the presence of two short-term creep mechanisms, one occurring around 0.6â€“1.0 s, and another occurring around 10 s, and a long-term creep mechanism occurring much beyond 10 s. The results indicate that presence of capillary water seems to have a significant influence on creep compliance of cement paste loaded at early ages.},

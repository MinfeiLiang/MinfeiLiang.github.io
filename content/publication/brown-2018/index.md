abstract: Nanoindentation phase characterization is used with a homogenization method
  to estimate the macroscopic response of heterogeneous, multiphase materials with
  large chemically-induced gradients from their measured micromechanical properties.
  The method was applied to predict the macroscopic response of a non-uniformly degraded
  cement paste from leaching-induced decalcification by ammonium nitrate under 3-dimensional
  exposure conditions. Coupled nanoindentation with scanning electron microscopy and
  energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy constitutive phase elemental analysis was used
  to link the mechanical response at each nanoindentation location to chemical composition
  and relate the mechanical phases identified statistically by Gaussian deconvolution
  to the chemical phases present in the microstructure. The nanoindentation phase
  characterization-based micro-macroscale upscaling method provided quantitative characterization
  of the relationship between microstructure evolution and mechanical properties as
  a function of chemical changes. The calculated homogenized elastic moduli of the
  reference and decalcified cement pastes ranged from 24.2–31.2 GPa and 9.2–11.7 GPa,
  respectively, and were of similar magnitude to the dynamic elastic moduli measured
  experimentally (31.1 ± 0.9 GPa and 13.7 ± 1.7 GPa, respectively). Furthermore, the
  degradation of the cement paste macroscale elastic modulus was controlled by the
  decalcification of the calcium-silicate-hydrate phases and the mechanical properties
  of the most prominent zone of the material.

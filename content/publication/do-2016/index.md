abstract: Â© 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. This paper presents a new approach
  to model the creep behavior of cement paste at early ages. The creep behavior is
  simulated by applying a time-varying generalized Maxwell model on the individual
  elements of a finite-element mesh of a simulated three-dimensional microstructure
  and compared with results in the literature. All mechanical properties of the constituent
  phases are taken from literature and Maxwell chain parameters are obtained by fitting
  the intrinsic creep of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). A reasonable agreement
  between the simulations and the experimental results are obtained by assuming a
  constant C-S-H density of 2.0 g/cm 3 . It was found that better agreements could
  be obtained at low degree of hydrations, by assuming a loosely packed C-S-H growing
  in the microstructure. It was also found that the short-term creep characteristics
  of C-S-H from nanoindentation can be used to reproduce macroscopic creep at least
  over a few days. The results show how numerical models can be used to upscale phase
  characteristics to macroscopic properties of composites.

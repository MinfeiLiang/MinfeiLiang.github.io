abstract: Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), a multi-level cementitious composite
  that has properties influenced by constituents existing at different length scales,
  requires the combination of different modeling strategies to capture and understand
  its effective property. A multi-level (six levels) micromechanics-based homogenization
  is proposed to investigate the elastic mechanical properties of UHPC. Molecular
  dynamics and micromechanical theories based on Eshelby's inclusion model are adopted
  to investigate the effects of the properties of the various constituents, such as
  the fiber type, volume fraction, orientation, geometry, including the size and volume
  fraction of coarse aggregates on the elastic mechanical properties of UHPC. Experimental
  investigations incorporating a compressive strength test, scanning electron microscopy,
  and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests were conducted to validate the model. The
  proposed multi-level homogenization scheme is able to quantitatively prove the importance
  of each constituent and provide a modeling tool capable of facilitating a thorough
  investigation of the mechanical properties of UHPC.

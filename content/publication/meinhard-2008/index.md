abstract: Recently, the heat release during cement hydration and the so-caused temperature
  rise was exploited for (i) identification of material properties of early-age cement-based
  materials (stiffness, strength), and (ii) determination of the diameter and the
  cement content of jet-grouted structures. In this paper, the underlying hydration
  model for determination of the heat release and its rate is refined for Ordinary
  Portland Cements (OPC) and extended towards blended cements. Hereby, the overall
  degree of hydration with one kinetic law is replaced by a multi-phase hydration
  model, taking the hydration kinetics of the main clinker phases into account. As
  regards blended cements, which are commonly used in engineering practice, the effect
  of slag hydration is incorporated into the presented multi-phase model. The developed
  hydration model for both plain and blended cement is validated by means of differential-calorimetry
  (DC) experiments. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

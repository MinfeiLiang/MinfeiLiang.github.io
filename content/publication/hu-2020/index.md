abstract: In this paper, compacts of synthetic calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) with
  0.8–1.5 calcium-to‑silicon ratio (Ca/Si) and 30–80% porosity were prepared by one-direction
  cold pressing. The Young's modulus and the creep of C-S-H compacts were measured
  by microindentation. The degree of homogeneity achievable with the preparation method,
  the presence of cracks and their extent were investigated by scanning electron microscopy
  and X-ray tomography. The porosity significantly influences the Young's modulus
  and the creep of the compacts, while the Ca/Si has limited influence on the Young's
  modulus. The C-S-H compacts with higher Ca/Si exhibit lower creep than those with
  lower Ca/Si, however mainly due to the presence of portlandite at higher Ca/Si values.
  The calculated Young's modulus of C-S-H solids falls into the range 21–50 GPa. The
  contact creep modulus of C-S-H with similar porosity as in a hardened cement paste
  (close to 30%) is about 180 GPa.

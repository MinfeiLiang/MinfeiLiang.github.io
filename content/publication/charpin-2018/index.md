abstract: "This paper presents a 12-year-long creep and shrinkage experimental campaign
  on cylindrical and prismatic concrete samples under uniaxial and biaxial stress,
  respectively. The motivation for the study is the need for predicting the delayed
  strains and the pre-stress loss of concrete containment buildings of nuclear power
  plants. Two subjects are central in this regard: the creep strain's long-term evolution
  and the creep Poisson's ratio. A greater understanding of these areas is necessary
  to ensure reliable predictions of the long-term behavior of the concrete containment
  buildings. Long-term basic creep appears to evolve as a logarithm function of time
  in the range of 3 to 10 years of testing. Similar trends are observed for drying
  creep, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage testing, which suggests that all
  delayed strains obtained using different loading and drying conditions originate
  from a common mechanism. The creep Poisson's ratio derived from the biaxial tests
  is approximately constant over time for both the basic and drying creep tests (creep
  strains corrected by the shrinkage strain). It is also shown that the biaxial non-drying
  samples undergo a significant increase in Young's modulus after 10 years."

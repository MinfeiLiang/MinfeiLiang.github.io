abstract: The dependence of creep on load duration (t-t') as well as age at loadin
  9 t' is described by the law [l +q)Lt'-\"(t-t')\"]/Eo, in which m, n, qol, Eo= material
  parameters which are determined fi'om test data by optimization techniques. The
  law is limited to basic creep, but with different values of material parameters
  it can also describe dryin9 creep up to a certain time. The previous formulations
  are extended by introducing the age dependence. This also enhances the reliability
  in tong-term extrapolation of creep data. Substitutin 9 t-t'= O. 001 clay, the law
  also yiehts the correct age dependance of the conventional elastic modulus, E. U\"
  Eo, which is much larger than E, were replaced by E (as implied by previous power
  laws without age dependence), the age dependence of creep curves obtained by data
  analysis would be more scattered, the age dependence of E would have to be described
  by a separate formula, and more material parameters would be necessary to fit test
  data. The simplicity of the double power law is a major advantage for statistical
  evaluation of test data.

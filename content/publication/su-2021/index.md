abstract: Accurately predicting the interfacial bond strength (IBS) between concrete
  and fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) has been a challenging problem in the evaluation
  and maintenance of reinforced concrete (RC) structures strengthened by FRP laminates.
  In this work, we employ three different machine learning (ML) approaches, including
  a multiple linear regression (MLR), a support vector machine (SVM), and an artificial
  neural network (ANN), to establish the correlation between influencing variables
  and the IBS and then to predict the IBS. Two datasets containing the single-lap
  shear test results for FRP laminates externally bonded on concrete prisms and externally
  bonded on the grooves of concrete prisms are used to train the three selected ML
  approaches and test their performances. The predicted results show that SVM-ML has
  the best accuracy and efficiency among the three approaches. By comparing it with
  the existing empirical IBS models, we find that the developed SVM-ML method shows
  the same or better prediction accuracy on both datasets. Furthermore, based on the
  SVM model, the relationships between influencing variables and the IBS are analyzed
  through partial dependence plots. In addition, the stacking strategy of ML is adopted
  to further improve the prediction accuracy for IBS. The ML method explored in this
  work is proven to be feasible and efficient for predicting the IBS of RC structures
  strengthened by FRP laminates.

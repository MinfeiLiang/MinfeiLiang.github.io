abstract: This article presents an experimental comparative study of the early-age
  behavior of binary and ternary cementitious matrices, combining Portland cement
  (PC), ground granulated blast furnace slag (BFS) and limestone filler (LF). The
  objective of this work was to quantify the influence of the composition of various
  blended binders on their physico-chemical evolution and early-age autogenous cracking
  risk. For this purpose, measurements of the rate of reactions, chemical shrinkage,
  autogenous shrinkage in free and restrained conditions and mechanical performances
  were performed on 12 binders prepared with the same water-to-cementitious materials
  ratio (w/cm = 0.32) and various dosages of PC, BFS and LF. The result analysis showed
  that the dilution effect reduced the early-age chemical shrinkage while the filler
  effect and the slag reactions tended to accelerate its development after a few hours
  of hydration. The substitution of PC with BFS and LF also led to both refining the
  28-days pore size distribution measured by mercury intrusion and increasing the
  magnitude of early-age free autogenous shrinkage. However, in spite of their higher
  autogenous shrinkage potential, the binary and ternary binders very often exhibited
  later autogenous cracking ages than the control Portland cement paste. Â© 2014 Elsevier

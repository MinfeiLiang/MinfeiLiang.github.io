abstract: 'A 2.5D laminated carbon-carbon composite was studied in the present work.
  Measurements of density were made by a non-contact and non-destructive method: X-ray
  tomography. The experimental procedure and artefact correction are described in
  detail in this paper. The mechanical characterisation was made by tensile, compression,
  and torsional tests. The role of oxidation on mechanical properties for all these
  stress states was estimated. The link between the mechanical properties and the
  changes induced by oxidation of the material density was established. Overall, oxidation
  leads to a reduction of the initial moduli. This work shows also that X-ray tomography
  is a good tool for measuring, by a non-destructive method, the material density
  over a given volume. Potentially, the results obtained by destructive mechanical
  tests on laboratory specimens and by non-destructive X-ray tomography techniques
  on large scale parts can be put together in order to estimate, in a non-destructive
  way, the mechanical properties in some locations of that part. © 2001 Elsevier Science

abstract: Early-age cracking of concrete may influence the long-term durability of
  a structure. Cracking occurs when the tensile stress in concrete exceeds its tensile
  strength. Early-age stress development in concrete is influenced by temperature
  changes, modulus of elasticity, creep or stress relaxation, shrinkage and coefficient
  of thermal expansion, and the degree of restraint. Three-dimensional finite-element
  analysis was used to model the early-age stress development of concrete, and a rate-type
  creep analysis was used herein. Four creep compliance models, including the B3 Model,
  Modified B3 Model, B3 Model with RT, and B4 Model were incorporated in the finite-element
  model. Experimental results from restraint of volume change tests with a rigid cracking
  frame were used to assess the accuracy of the finite-element analysis. The experimental
  tests included 63 concrete mixtures, which contained varying cementitious materials,
  mixture proportions, temperature histories, aggregate types, water:cementitious
  materials ratios, and chemical admixtures. The results showed that the finite-element
  model provides accurate predictions of measured early-age concrete stresses. The
  Modified B3 Model provided the most accurate prediction of the measured early-age
  concrete stresses.

abstract: <p>This study presents comprehensive numerical modeling methods for simulating
  early‐age stress (EAS) relaxation in cementitious materials, based on the autogenous
  deformation (AD), elastic modulus, creep, and stress continuously tested by a mini
  temperature stress testing machine (Mini‐TSTM) and a mini AD testing machine from
  a very early age (i.e., from a few hours to a week). Four methods for converting
  creep compliance to relaxation modulus were discussed in detail and used for the
  one‐dimensional (1D) and three‐dimensional (3D) simulation of stress evolution in
  the Mini‐TSTM test. Furthermore, virtual creep and relaxation tests were conducted
  using an exponential algorithm with either the Kelvin or Maxwell chains to show
  their applicability in simulating the viscoelastic behavior of early‐age cementitious
  materials. The results showed that the exponential algorithm with the Maxwell chain
  using an exponential conversion function from creep to relaxation obtains good prediction
  accuracy of EAS in 3D analysis. The numerical solutions of the Volterra integral
  of creep compliance can lead to a negative relaxation modulus, thus introducing
  stress calculation errors in both 1D and 3D analysis.</p>

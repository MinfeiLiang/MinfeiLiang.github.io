abstract: Cracking occurrence due to shrinkage related effects is a widely recognised
  issue which is frequently evaluated with the shrinkage restraining ring test. This
  paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the ring test method, which has been
  used for the last four decades. The last review on such matter was conducted only
  in early 2000s; however, a significant amount of studies has been conducted since
  then and considerable advancements or modifications in this testing method have
  taken place over the last decade. Studies on the traditional ring test, i.e. a circular
  concrete ring cast around a steel ring, are identified and the history, tendencies,
  practices and quantitative methods are analysed thoroughly. Furthermore, any modifications/advancements
  in the testing method with respect to their purpose, applications and capabilities
  based on current knowledge, are addressed. Finally, an insight on the challenges
  that the developers of testing methods for restrained shrinkage are faced with is
  given together with perspectives for their future potential improvement.

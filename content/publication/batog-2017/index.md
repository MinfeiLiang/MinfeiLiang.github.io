abstract: Hereby paper presents the results of the research on determining the impact
  of cement and aggregate type on the formation of hardening temperature and mechanical
  properties of concrete. In the study, the six cement types, which contain up to
  70% of main non-clinker constituents and four types of aggregate (basalt, granite,
  limestone and gravel) were used. The test results showed that cements with low clinker
  content allow to significantly reduce hardening temperature of concrete and thus,
  minimize the risk of cracks formation in concrete. Aggregate type has not affected
  concrete hardening temperature. However, it has an impact on magnitude of generated
  thermal stresses, caused by different thermal expansion coefficients of the aggregates.
  The most favourable aggregate types to use in mass concrete from the all analysed
  are granite, basalt and limestone. Usage of gravel aggregate in concrete, consisting
  mainly of quartz, might lead in certain unfavourable conditions to crack formation,
  caused by generated thermal stresses.

abstract: 'Abstract: The ability to accurately determine the applied load is critical
  in measuring hardness, which is traditionally defined as the ratio of the applied
  load to the projected contact area in the case of instrumented indentation. The
  magnitude of the applied load is unambiguous when the load is monotonically increased
  or held constant. However, in the case of nanoindentation testing with continuous
  stiffness measurement (CSM), wherein an oscillatory load is superimposed on the
  primary load, what one should use for the load has significant implications especially
  for rate-dependent materials. In this work, a concept of an effective load during
  nanoindentation creep testing with CSM is proposed based on a theoretical analysis.
  The analytical model is experimentally validated, and good agreement is found with
  the experimental results, even when the material exhibits a strong indentation size
  effect (ISE). The findings of this work have important implications for accurately
  measuring the rate dependence of hardness, especially during high-temperature nanoindentation
  testing. Graph abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]'

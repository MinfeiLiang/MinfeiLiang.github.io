abstract: Autogenous shrinkage of cement paste depends on the competition between
  bulk stress (driving force) and deformation restriction (intrinsic modulus). Since
  the bulk stress can be calculated according to capillary theory, the deformation
  restriction contributed by unhydrated phase should be paid more attention due to
  its higher proportion and modulus. However, it is hard to trace the development
  of unhydrated particles distribution and time-dependent modulus in real time. To
  clarify the deformation restriction of unhydrated phase, cement pastes consist of
  nearly fully-hydrated matrix and inert fillers with targeted size and volume were
  prepared in the present study. Based on the bulk stress calculated by saturation
  degree and the modulus obtained by upscaling calculation, an empirical function
  was proposed to link autogenous shrinkage, internal stress, and deformation restriction
  of cement paste directly. Moreover, the deformation restriction mechanism of unhydrated
  particles was explained by the effective volume of restricted region around the
  unhydrated particle, and the deformation restriction can be maximized by rationally
  arranging unhydrated phase with volume content of 30–40% and particle size of 5–10
  μm. The results provide a new sight in understanding the deformation restriction
  of unhydrated phase, and then lay a solid foundation to minimize the shrinkage of
  cement-based materials by microstructurally design of cement paste.

abstract: As the input parameters in multiscale modeling the effective elastic modulus
  of the hardened cement paste, the elastic moduli of individual phases are crucial
  for assuring the accuracy of the homogenization estimate. In this study, the mechanical
  properties and the fractions of individual phases are measured by nanoindentation
  and back scattered electron image analysis, respectively. The mechanical properties
  of the hardened paste at microscale are measured by microindentation. The effect
  of individual phases including the CSH, the residual clinker and the capillary pore
  on the effective modulus of the hardened cement paste is quantified. It is found
  that the effective modulus of pore needs to be set as 12 GPa rather than 0 GPa as
  the input for homogenization. As for the solid phases, the variation of the clinker
  modulus has limited influence on the homogenized modulus of the hardened cement
  paste. Whereas, the homogenized paste modulus increases significantly with the increasing
  fraction of high density CSH and the decreasing fraction of low density CSH. The
  results of this study can help to select appropriate input parameters for multiscale
  modeling the mechanical properties of cementitious materials.

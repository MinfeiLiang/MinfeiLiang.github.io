abstract: 'This paper proposes a new algorithm called multi-objective genetic programming
  (MOGP) for complex civil engineering systems. The proposed technique effectively
  combines the model structure selection ability of a standard genetic programming
  with the parameter estimation power of classical regression, and it simultaneously
  optimizes both the complexity and goodness-of-fit in a system through a non-dominated
  sorting algorithm. The performance of MOGP is illustrated by modeling a complex
  civil engineering problem: the time-dependent total creep of concrete. A Big Data
  is used for the model development so that the proposed concrete creep model—referred
  to as a “genetic programming based creep model” or “G-C model” in this study—is
  valid for both normal and high strength concrete with a wide range of structural
  properties. The G-C model is then compared with currently accepted creep prediction
  models. The G-C model obtained by MOGP is simple, straightforward to use, and provides
  more accurate predictions than other prediction models.'

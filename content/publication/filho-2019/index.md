abstract: Manystudies have already been published concerning autogenous shrinkage
  in cementitious materials. Still, no consensus can be found in the literature regarding
  the determination of the time-zero to initiate the recording of autogenous shrinkage.
  With internal curing agents, a correct evaluation of their efficiency depends on
  an appropriate choice of the time-zero. This study investigates different approaches
  to estimate the time-zero for cement paste mixtures with and without superabsorbent
  polymers as internal curing agents. The initial and final setting times were determined
  by an electronic Vicat and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements (UPV); the transition
  point between the fluid and solid state was determined from the autogenous strain
  curve; the development of the capillary pressure was also studied. The choice of
  time-zero before the transition point led to higher values of shrinkage strain that
  should not be taken into account for autogenous shrinkage. A negligible difference
  was found between the strains when the final setting time and the transition point
  were taken as time-zero. Considering the artefacts and practical issues involving
  the different methods, the use of the transition point from the autogenous strain
  curve is the most suitable technique for determining the time-zero.

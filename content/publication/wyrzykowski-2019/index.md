abstract: In this work, the uniaxial creep in compression during the first days of
  hydration is studied experimentally on cement pastes with w/c of 0.50. In order
  to assess the effect of the evolving microstructure on creep, the so-called equivalent
  systems are employed. In these systems, part of the otherwise unhydrated cement
  is replaced with inert filler (quartz powder). With this approach, non-aging systems
  are obtained that can emulate specific microstructural features of the real hydrating
  systems. Despite the very similar elastic Young's moduli of the real and their corresponding
  equivalent systems, the real hydrating systems experienced much higher creep in
  the first weeks after loading than the equivalent, inert systems. The differences
  in creep could be explained either by possibly different morphologies of the hydrates
  in the two types of systems, intrinsic aging or with the active role of the hydration
  process in increasing creep (dissolution theory of creep).

abstract: Visual inspection has been the most widely used technique for monitoring
  concrete structures in service. Inspectors visually evaluate defects based on experience,
  skill, and engineering judgment. However, this process is subjective, laborious,
  time-consuming, and hampered by demanding access to numerous parts of complex structures.
  Accordingly, the present study proposes a nearly automated inspection model based
  on image processing and deep learning for detecting defects in typically inaccessible
  areas of concrete structures. Results indicate that using the Keras classifier combined
  with Otsu image processing can achieve superior classification accuracy of 97.63%,
  96.5%, and 96.17% for training, validation, and testing data, respectively, along
  with low quantification error of 1.5%, 5% and 2% for the crack length, width, and
  angle of orientation, respectively. The type of structural damage and its severity
  are identified based on the allowed range of concrete crack width for different
  structures, including buildings and bridges based on different international standards
  and codes. The proposed method can deploy unmanned aerial vehicle image acquisition
  to offer a nearly automated inspection platform for the colossal backlog of aging
  concrete structures.

abstract: This study develops a computational framework for highly efficient generation
  of realistic mesoscale concrete models by exploiting micro XCT 3D images, a bin
  packing algorithm and an open-source dynamic physics engine (“Bullet”). The aggregates
  extracted from an XCT image dataset are first smoothed by the HC-Laplacian algorithm
  and then surface-meshed with optimisation. A library of aggregates characterised
  with five shape indices is then built and subsequently used with a “greedy search”
  bin packing algorithm to generate meso-models of concrete according to specified
  volume fraction and size gradation. To build concrete models with high compactness,
  for example, with 40–60% contents of aggregates, the Bullet physics engine, based
  on a hard-contact discrete element method, is further applied to simulate the complicated
  compaction and vibration process in real casting procedures. The developed framework
  provides a promising basis for further mesoscale studies, such as 3D printing, multiscale
  homogenization, damage and fracture mechanisms, and environmental factors-induced
  degradation.

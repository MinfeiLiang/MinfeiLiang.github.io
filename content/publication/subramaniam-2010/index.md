abstract: The response of hydrating cement paste through setting are monitored using
  rheological measurements and ultrasonic reflection measurements. Increases in the
  elastic modulus and yield stress of cement paste with time are obtained from the
  rheological measurements. Ultrasonic measurements are performed using horizontally
  polarized shear waves (SH) reflected off of the hydrating cement paste. Changes
  in the ultrasonic signal through setting are related with changes in the porosity
  and stiffness of an equivalent water-filled poroelastic material, which provides
  identical acoustic impedance. The measured changes in the shear modulus obtained
  from ultrasonic measurement are shown to correlate well with increase in elastic
  modulus obtained from rheological measurements. The increase in the shear modulus
  of the porous material obtained from the ultrasonic measurements is shown to correspond
  well with the observed increase in the yield stress of the cement paste. By combining
  the information from rheological and ultrasonic measurements, it is found that even
  in the fluid stage there is sufficient structural integrity in the arrangement of
  cement grains to support low-amplitude shear stress and the evolution of a continuously
  connected network of cement particles within the paste is coincident with a rapid
  increase in the shear modulus of the porous skeleton. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

abstract: We propose an investigation combining numerical and analytical tools to
  estimate the ageing viscoelastic properties of cement-based materials within a multiscale
  framework. With analytical homogenization the properties at the cement paste and
  mortar scales are estimated by a combination of Generalized Self-Consistent (GSC)
  and Mori-Tanaka (MT) schemes. With numerical homogenization the effective properties
  at the concrete scale are estimated. Numerical homogenization has the advantage
  of allowing assessing local information and to study more complex geometries. This
  combined strategy constitutes a promising tool to investigate how different mechanisms
  leading to ageing at the hydrated products scale, as well as other features of cement-based
  materials such as the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), affect the viscoelastic
  behaviour at superior scales. In this context, we study the solidification of non-ageing
  constituents as the mechanisms leading to the ageing behaviour combined or not with
  a space-filling process in C-S-H. Relaxation and creep results are presented.

abstract: In this paper we proceed in the examination of different aspects of the
  application of statistical nanoindentation to hydrated cement pastes for determining
  the mechanical properties of the single phases. In particular, we evaluate the size
  of the uniform domains of hydration products in a volume of cement paste obtained
  by Focussed-Ion Beam Nanotomography and we show that the uniform domains are too
  small to origin separate peaks in the frequency plots. Finally, we show that the
  procedure of fitting the frequency plots by Gaussian distributions of different
  sizes is not robust and heavily relies on assumptions about the elastic properties
  of the different phases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

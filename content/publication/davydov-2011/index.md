abstract: Several open questions related to the experimental protocol and processing
  of data acquired by the nano-indentation (NI) technique are investigated. The volume
  fractions of mechanically different phases obtained from statistical NI (SNI) analysis
  are shown to be different from those obtained by back-scattered electron (BSE) image
  analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) method on the same paste. Judging from transmission
  electron microscope (TEM) images, the representative volume element of low-density
  calcium-silicate hydrates (C-S-H) can be considered to be around 500 nm, whereas
  for high-density C-S-H it is about 100 nm. This raises the question how the appropriate
  penetration depth for NI experiments should be selected. Changing the maximum load
  from 1 mN to 5 mN, the effect of penetration depth on the experimental results is
  studied. As an alternative to the SNI method, a \"manual\" indentation method is
  proposed, which combines information from BSE and atomic-force microscopy (AFM),
  coupled to the NI machine. The AFM allows to precisely indent a high-density C-S-H
  rim around unhydrated clinkers in cement paste. Yet the results from that technique
  still show a big scatter. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

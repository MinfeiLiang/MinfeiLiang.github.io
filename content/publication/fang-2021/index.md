abstract: 'This paper systematically investigates the micromechanical properties of
  interfacial transition zone (ITZ) in alkali-activated fly ash-slag (AAFS) concrete
  using nanoindentation, backscattered electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.
  Results indicate that the micromechanical properties of ITZ depend on the chemical
  composition of reaction products and its microstructural characteristics. The ITZ
  with high proportion of N-C-A-S-H and C-A-S-H gels tends to have high elastic modulus
  because of their superior micromechanical properties. The formation of reaction
  products would refine the microstructure of ITZ and improve its elastic modulus.
  The evolution of micromechanical properties of ITZ can be divided into three stages:
  (i) accelerated growth stage via fast chemical reactions (<12 h); (ii) stationary
  stage via stable chemical reactions (12 h-7 d); (iii) decrement stage via microcrack
  propagation (7 d-28 d). ITZ is not the weakest region in AAFS concrete due to its
  desired micromechanical properties and compact microstructure compared to paste
  matrix.'

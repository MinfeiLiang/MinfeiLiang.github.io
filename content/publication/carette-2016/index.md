abstract: A recent scientific and industrial interest has been brought to combine
  multiple supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in large quantities in concrete
  binders. The growing use of binary, ternary or quaternary cement binders calls for
  the development of simple, efficient and accurate experimental means to characterise
  and predict the behaviour of such concretes. Continuous non-destructive testing
  constitutes a major opportunity since it generally consists in simple test setup
  requiring low human interaction. In this study, isothermal calorimetry and ultrasonic
  pulse velocity (compression and shear waves) are performed on various concrete compositions
  with massive incorporation of limestone filler and blast-furnace slag. Indeed, these
  two additions present interesting complementary effects and positive synergies in
  terms of fresh properties, mechanical behaviour and durability potential. The hydration
  process of these concretes is investigated, and a new model is presented for representing
  the hydration degree of SCM-based binders. Then, the apparent activation energy
  is studied through tests at various temperature. Ultrasonic measurements are shown
  to provide a good alternative to isothermal calorimetry for the monitoring of the
  apparent activation energy of concrete during the first days of hydration.

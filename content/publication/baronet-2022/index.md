abstract: A recent survey has showed the prediction of the long-term deflection of
  existing concrete bridges after several decades is a great challange in civil engineering.
  The crux is to predict the creep deflection of a concrete structure after several
  decades from laboratory tests carried out over few months. This work aims at combining
  microindentation tests and as short as possible Uniaxial Compression Creep Test
  (UCCT) to characterize the modulus C and the characteristic time τch of the compliance
  function of basic creep used in modern design codes. First, concrete samples made
  of cement paste, mortar and concrete with a water-to-cement ratio of 0.6 were cured
  and loaded in sealed condition at a age of 90 days under UCCT for a duration of
  1 year. A convergence study showed that the duration of UCCT which is needed to
  accurately estimate the characteristic time τch and creep modulus C is about 30
  days and 300 days, respectively. Then, the creep modulus C was measured by microindentation
  tests on the cement paste and homogenized at the scale of mortar and concrete by
  micromechanics. Finally, the compliance creep function obtained by the proposed
  two-scale method was compared to experimental results which are available in open
  literature and other ones of existing design models, such as the model code 2010
  and the well-established B4 model. As main result, the proposed simplified method
  which combines short (2-month) UCCT and rapid microindentation tests showed to be
  practical and accurate to characterize the basic creep compliance function of concrete.

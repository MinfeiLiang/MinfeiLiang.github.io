abstract: In this study, the acoustic emission activity of cement pastes was investigated
  during the first day of hydration. Deaired, fresh cement pastes were cast in sealed
  sample holders designed to minimize friction and restraint. The majority of acoustic
  emission events occurred in lower water to cement ratio pastes, while cement pastes
  with higher water to cement ratios showed significantly less acoustic activity.
  These acoustic events occurred around the time of setting. A layer of water on the
  surface of the cement pastes substantially reduced acoustic emission activity at
  the time of setting. According to these experimental results, the acoustic emission
  measured around setting time was attributed to cavitation events occurring in the
  pores of the cement paste due to self-desiccation. This paper shows how acoustic
  emission might be used to indicate the time when the fluid-solid transition occurs
  in a cement paste, often referred to as time-zero. Knowledge of time-zero is fundamental
  for determining when mechanical properties develop and in calculations of residual
  stresses. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

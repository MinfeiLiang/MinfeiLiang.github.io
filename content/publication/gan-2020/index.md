abstract: This study proposes an experimental method for studying the short-term creep
  behaviour of cement paste at micro-scale. The micro-bending tests on miniaturized
  cantilever beams were used to characterize the viscoelastic properties of cement
  paste. The effects of w/b ratio, the type of binder and the stress level on the
  microscopic creep behaviour were investigated. It is found that the short-term creep
  of cement paste at microscale can be satisfactorily described by a power-law function.
  A linear viscoelastic behaviour has been observed in different cementitious systems
  at the microscale with the stress level up to 67.9%. When compared with the creep
  results in microindentation tests and conventional macroscopic tests, the obtained
  creep compliance function in this study is found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively
  representative of the macroscopic results. This experimental study underlines the
  importance of microstructural effect on the creep behaviours of cementitious materials
  at microscale.

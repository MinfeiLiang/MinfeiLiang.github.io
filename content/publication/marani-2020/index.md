abstract: There have been abundant experimental studies exploring ultra-high-performance
  concrete (UHPC) in recent years. However, the relationships between the engineering
  properties of UHPC and its mixture composition are highly nonlinear and difficult
  to delineate using traditional statistical methods. There is a need for robust and
  advanced methods that can streamline the diverse pertinent experimental data available
  to create predictive tools with superior accuracy and provide insight into its nonlinear
  materials science aspects. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can unravel
  underlying patterns in complex data. Accordingly, this study endeavors to employ
  state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength
  of UHPC using a comprehensive experimental database retrieved from the open literature
  consisting of 810 test observations and 15 input features. A novel approach based
  on tabular generative adversarial networks was used to generate 6513 plausible synthetic
  data for training robust machine learning models, including random forest, extra
  trees, and gradient boosting regression. While the models were trained using the
  synthetic data, their ability to generalize their predictions was tested on the
  810 experimental data thus far unknown and never presented to the models. The results
  indicate that the developed models achieved outstanding predictive performance.
  Parametric studies using the models were able to provide insight into the strength
  development mechanisms of UHPC and the significance of the various influential parameters.

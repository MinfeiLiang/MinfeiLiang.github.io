abstract: It has long been recognized, in cement chemistry, that two types of calcium-silicate-hydrate
  (C-S-H) exist in cement-based materials, but less is known about how the two types
  of C-S-H affect the mechanical properties. By means of nanoindentation tests on
  nondegraded and calcium leached cement paste, the paper confirms the existence of
  two types of C-S-H, and investigates the distinct role played by the two phases
  on the elastic properties of cement-based materials. It is found that (1) high-density
  C-S-H are mechanically less affected by calcium leaching than low density C-S-H,
  and (2) the volume fractions occupied by the two phases in the C-S-H matrix are
  not affected by calcium leaching. The nanoindentation results also provide quantitative
  evidence, suggesting that the elastic properties of the C-S-H phase are intrinsic
  material properties that do not depend on mix proportions of cement-based materials.
  The material properties and volume fractions are used in a novel two-step homogenization
  model, that predicts the macroscopic elastic properties of cement pastes with high
  accuracy. Combined with advanced physical chemistry models that allow, for a given
  w/c ratio, determination of the volume fractions of the two types of C-S-H, the
  model can be applied to any cement paste, with or without Portlandite, Clinker,
  and so on. In particular, from an application of the model to decalcified cement
  pastes, it is shown that that the decalcification of the C-S-H phase is the primary
  source of the macroscopic elastic modulus degradation, that dominates over the effect
  of the dissolution of Portlandite in cement-based material systems. Â© 2003 Elsevier

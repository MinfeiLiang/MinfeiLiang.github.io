abstract: Analysis of nanoindentation experiments assumes that the indentation occurs
  on a flat surface. As a result, the accuracy of nanoindentation depends on reducing
  the surface roughness to a tolerable level. Within the context of statistical nanoindentation
  techniques suitable for heterogeneous materials, this study presents a criterion
  for roughness of cement paste surfaces for nanoindentation, and describes a method
  for obtaining the desired roughness. Through a systematic experimental study, we
  show the evolution of roughness and nanomechanical properties from indentation as
  a function of increased polishing. We conclude that the root-mean-squared (RMS)
  roughness of the sample, taken over a square area with edge dimensions of 200 times
  the average indentation depth of the dominating phase of the material, should be
  less than five times the average indentation depth of the dominating phase of the
  material. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

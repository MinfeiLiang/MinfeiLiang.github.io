 abstract = {Cracking may occur in massive concrete structures at early-age. Thermal strains and autogenous shrinkage (which is not studied in this paper) can be restrained by boundary conditions which induce stresses in concrete. If their amplitude is too large, cracks appear. At this stage, creep plays an important and positive role to limit their extent. However, it is still difficult to assess creep in concrete. For instance, a review of the literature shows that there is no consensus on the influence of the state of stress (compression or tension) upon creep. A modeling is introduced to take into account a possible dissymmetry of creep in tension and in compression. A simplified representation of the behavior at early age in a massive concrete structure shows the consequences of different creep modeling.},

abstract: Cracking may occur in massive concrete structures at early-age. Thermal
  strains and autogenous shrinkage (which is not studied in this paper) can be restrained
  by boundary conditions which induce stresses in concrete. If their amplitude is
  too large, cracks appear. At this stage, creep plays an important and positive role
  to limit their extent. However, it is still difficult to assess creep in concrete.
  For instance, a review of the literature shows that there is no consensus on the
  influence of the state of stress (compression or tension) upon creep. A modeling
  is introduced to take into account a possible dissymmetry of creep in tension and
  in compression. A simplified representation of the behavior at early age in a massive
  concrete structure shows the consequences of different creep modeling.

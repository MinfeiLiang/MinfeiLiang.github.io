abstract: This study introduces a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach
  for structural health monitoring (SHM) that exploits a form of measured compressed
  response data through transfer learning (TL)-based techniques. The implementation
  of the proposed methodology allows damage identification and localization within
  a realistic large-scale system. To validate the proposed method, first, a well-known
  benchmark model is numerically simulated. Using acceleration response histories,
  as well as compressed response data in terms of discrete histograms, CNN models
  are trained, and the robustness of the CNN architectures is evaluated. Finally,
  pretrained CNNs are fine-tuned to be adaptable for three-parameter, extremely compressed
  response data, based on the response mean, standard deviation, and a scale factor.
  The performance of each CNN implementation is assessed using training accuracy histories
  as well as confusion matrices, along with other performance metrics. In addition
  to the numerical study, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using
  experimental vibration response data for verification and validation. The results
  indicate that deep TL can be implemented effectively for SHM of similar structural
  systems with different types of sensors.

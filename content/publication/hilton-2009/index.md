abstract: The concept of elastic Timoshenko shear coefficients is used as a guide
  for linear viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beams subjected to simultaneous bending
  and twisting. It is shown that the corresponding Timoshenko viscoelastic functions
  now depend not only on material properties and geometry as they do in elasticity,
  but also additionally on stresses and their time histories. Possible viscoelastic
  definitions are formulated and evaluated. In general, the viscoelastic relations
  are sufficiently complicated so that the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle
  (analogy) cannot be applied. This is particularly true for, but not limited to,
  elastic shear coefficients which are Poisson ratio dependent. Expressions for equivalent
  viscoelastic Timoshenko shear functions must, therefore, be derived de novo on a
  case by case basis, taking in to account specific relaxation moduli, stresses, temperatures
  and their time histories. Thus the elastic simplicity and generality is lost and
  hence rendering the use of viscoelastic Timoshenko shear functions as highly impractical.
  Consequently, it is necessary to directly solve the coupled viscoelastic beam governing
  relations for bending and twisting deflections by using appropriate solution protocols
  as discussed herein. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, B. V.

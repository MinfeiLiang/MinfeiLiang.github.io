abstract: The available models for estimating the creep strains of concrete generally
  assume concrete as a homogeneous material. Since concrete is a composite, such models
  cannot take into account incompatible strains between cement paste and aggregates
  during creep loading. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that initial
  defects could increase the creep strain level and justify the application of a coupling
  between creep and damage at the macroscopic scale. To do so, different contents
  of air-entraining agent were used to simulate the internal defects of concrete and
  high-stress continuous load was applied to concrete samples with different initial
  defects. By analyzing the stress-strain curves of concretes containing different
  initial defects after compression, it was concluded that the existence of internal
  defects had a significant effect on the basic mechanical properties of concrete
  samples. Acoustic emission technology was used to obtain the internal acoustic emission
  response of concrete samples under high stress. Creep development rate is nonlinear
  to load holding level based on the analysis of experimental data and internal structure
  of concrete samples.

 abstract = {This paper aims to evaluate the elastic modulus of concrete with nanoidentation technique and homogenization method. In this paper, concrete is divided into two parts: coarse pore and matrix. It is assumed that matrix is composed of five phases: stone aggregate, ITZ-1 (interfacial transition zone around stone aggregate), sand, ITZ-2 (interfacial transition zone around sand) and paste. Based on the Ca/Si ratio change in interface region, the thicknesses of interfacial transition zone around stone and sand were determined, respectively. The elastic moduli of stone, ITZ-1, sand, ITZ-2 and paste were determined by nanoidentation technique. The volume fraction of each phase was determined by Lu & Torquato model. The elastic modulus of matrix was calculated by Self-Consistent Method. Then, combining with the porosity of coarse pore determined by hardened concrete pore structure analyzer, the elastic modulus of concrete could be obtained by Mori-Tanaka method. Through comparison, it is found that the error between the theoretical calculation value and the macroscopic test value is within 10%. Therefore, the effectiveness of theoretical prediction model proposed in this paper was verified.},

abstract: 'This paper aims to evaluate the elastic modulus of concrete with nanoidentation
  technique and homogenization method. In this paper, concrete is divided into two
  parts: coarse pore and matrix. It is assumed that matrix is composed of five phases:
  stone aggregate, ITZ-1 (interfacial transition zone around stone aggregate), sand,
  ITZ-2 (interfacial transition zone around sand) and paste. Based on the Ca/Si ratio
  change in interface region, the thicknesses of interfacial transition zone around
  stone and sand were determined, respectively. The elastic moduli of stone, ITZ-1,
  sand, ITZ-2 and paste were determined by nanoidentation technique. The volume fraction
  of each phase was determined by Lu & Torquato model. The elastic modulus of matrix
  was calculated by Self-Consistent Method. Then, combining with the porosity of coarse
  pore determined by hardened concrete pore structure analyzer, the elastic modulus
  of concrete could be obtained by Mori-Tanaka method. Through comparison, it is found
  that the error between the theoretical calculation value and the macroscopic test
  value is within 10%. Therefore, the effectiveness of theoretical prediction model
  proposed in this paper was verified.'

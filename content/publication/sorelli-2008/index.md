abstract: Advances in engineering the microstructure of cementitious composites have
  led to the development of fiber reinforced Ultra High Performance Concretes (UHPC).
  The scope of this paper is twofold, first to characterize the nano-mechanical properties
  of the phases governing the UHPC microstructure by means of a novel statistical
  nanoindentation technique; then to upscale those nanoscale properties, by means
  of continuum micromechanics, to the macroscopic scale of engineering applications.
  In particular, a combined investigation of nanoindentation, scanning electron microscope
  (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) indicates that the fiber-matrix transition zone
  is relatively defect free. On this basis, a four-level multiscale model with defect
  free interfaces allows to accurately determine the composite stiffness from the
  measured nano-mechanical properties. Besides evidencing the dominant role of high
  density calcium silicate hydrates and the stiffening effect of residual clinker,
  the suggested model may become a useful tool for further optimizing cement-based
  engineered composites. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

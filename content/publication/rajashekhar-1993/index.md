abstract: Closed-form mechanical models to predict the behaviour of complex structural
  systems often are unavailable. Although reliability analysis of such systems can
  be carried out by Monte Carlo simulations, the large number of structural analyses
  required results in prohibitively high computational costs. By using polynomial
  approximations of actual limit states in the reliability analysis, the number of
  analyses required can be minimized. Such approximations are referred to as Response
  Surfaces. This paper briefly describes the response surface methodology and critically
  evaluates existing approaches for choosing the experimental points at which the
  structural analyses must be performed. Methods are investigated to incorporate information
  on probability distributions of random variables in selecting the experimental points
  and to ensure that the response surface fits the actual limit state in the region
  of maximum likelihood. A criterion for reduction in the number of experiments after
  the first iteration is suggested. Two numerical examples show the application of
  the approach. Â© 1993.

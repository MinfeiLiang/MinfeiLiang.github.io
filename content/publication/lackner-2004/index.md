abstract: 'This paper deals with the development and application of a three-dimensional
  material model for the simulation of early-age cracking of concrete. The starting
  point is the determination of the intrinsic material function for the fracture energy
  of early-age concrete. For this purpose, results of beam bending tests reported
  in [Proceedings of the SEM/RILEM International Conference on Fracture of Concrete
  and Rock. Houston, Texas, USA: 1987. p. 409] are employed. The intrinsic material
  function serves as input for the calibration of the Rankine fracture criterion formulated
  in the framework of chemoplasticity. Finally, the developed 3D material model is
  employed for a chemomechanical analysis of a roller-compacted-concrete dam. The
  temperature fields and the field of the degree of hydration required for this analysis
  are obtained from a preceding thermochemical analysis of the dam. Â© 2003 Elsevier

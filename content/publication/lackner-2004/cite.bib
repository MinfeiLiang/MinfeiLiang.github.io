 abstract = {This paper deals with the development and application of a three-dimensional material model for the simulation of early-age cracking of concrete. The starting point is the determination of the intrinsic material function for the fracture energy of early-age concrete. For this purpose, results of beam bending tests reported in [Proceedings of the SEM/RILEM International Conference on Fracture of Concrete and Rock. Houston, Texas, USA: 1987. p. 409] are employed. The intrinsic material function serves as input for the calibration of the Rankine fracture criterion formulated in the framework of chemoplasticity. Finally, the developed 3D material model is employed for a chemomechanical analysis of a roller-compacted-concrete dam. The temperature fields and the field of the degree of hydration required for this analysis are obtained from a preceding thermochemical analysis of the dam. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract: Â© 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers. This paper presents a technique
  for computing the time-dependent behavior of reinforced and prestressed concrete
  as a composite material. This technique, when implemented in a finite-element model
  and assuming that the concrete and steel reinforcement act as a composite material,
  is computationally advantageous compared with explicitly modeling the concrete and
  steel materials separately. The method is developed assuming linear viscoelasticity
  and uncracked sections. The approach starts by first approximating the creep compliance
  functions for the viscoelastic concrete as a Kelvin chain model. This approximation
  allows the viscoelastic behavior to be framed as a rate-type creep law, which converts
  the analysis to an equivalent elastic problem, simplifying the computations. This
  approach, originally developed for plain concrete, is extended in this paper to
  account for the effects of linear elastic reinforcement. Several implementation
  examples are provided documenting the viability of the method for problems of uniaxial,
  multiaxial, and bending behaviors. For the presented cases, the composite method
  is shown to provide similar results compared with models containing explicitly modeled
  reinforcement. The paper concludes with a discussion regarding how to extend the
  methodology to the general case with linear viscoelastic reinforcement and matrix
  materials.

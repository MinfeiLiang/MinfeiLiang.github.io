abstract: In this paper, the hydration of slag in blended cements is investigated
  through the measurement of hydration reaction indicators such as portlandite content,
  non-evaporable and free water, and hydration heat. Three substitution rates of cement
  by slag were used (30%, 50% and 70%). The tests were performed at two constant temperatures
  (20 °C and 40 °C) in order to assess the activation energy of the different components.
  A multiphasic hydratation model is proposed to take account of the difference of
  kinetics of each main phase (clinker and slag) and the hydration kinetic law proposed
  considers interactions between the two phases. It includes the activation of the
  dissolution of slag by alkalis released by the clinker phases in the pore solution,
  the portlandite consumption by slag and the effect of temperature and moisture content
  on the reaction kinetics. The model is able to simulate the evolution of hydration
  products and adjust the hydration product stoechimetry to the rates of slag and
  the current temperature automatically and instantaneously. Its reliability is shown
  through its ability to fit the whole experimental plan results with a single parameter
  set. Among these parameters are the hydration heat of slag and its water consumption.
  The model and its parameters should be useful to simulate other types of slag-blended
  cement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

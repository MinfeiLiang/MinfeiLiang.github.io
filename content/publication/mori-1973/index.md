abstract: Having noted an important role of image stress in work hardening of dispersion
  hardened materials, (1,3) the present paper discusses a method of calculating the
  average internal stress in the matrix of a material containing inclusions with transformation
  strain. It is shown that the average stress in the matrix is uniform throughout
  the material and independent of the position of the domain where the average treatment
  is carried out. It is also shown that the actual stress in the matrix is the average
  stress plus the locally fluctuating stress, the average of which vanishes in the
  matrix. Average elastic energy is also considered by taking into account the effects
  of the interaction among the inclusions and of the presence of the free boundary.

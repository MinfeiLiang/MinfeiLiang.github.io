 abstract = {Having noted an important role of image stress in work hardening of dispersion hardened materials, (1,3) the present paper discusses a method of calculating the average internal stress in the matrix of a material containing inclusions with transformation strain. It is shown that the average stress in the matrix is uniform throughout the material and independent of the position of the domain where the average treatment is carried out. It is also shown that the actual stress in the matrix is the average stress plus the locally fluctuating stress, the average of which vanishes in the matrix. Average elastic energy is also considered by taking into account the effects of the interaction among the inclusions and of the presence of the free boundary. Â© 1973.},

abstract: In this study, the crack pattern and propagation in a random concrete surface
  has been examined using machine learning algorithm called voronoi diagrams. A random
  photo of a concrete crack located on the surface is taken from a common source and
  the crack dimensions and directions have been measured. After then, the crack has
  been divided into 12 parts to evaluate the machine learning algorithm's capability
  for estimating the crack pattern including its direction. Consequently, it has been
  shown that this novel technique is precise, quick, cheap and useful for monitoring
  and estimating crack propagation on concrete surfaces. Besides, it has great potential
  for not only cement and concrete industries and also for many different industries
  in the means of automation, sustainability, safety, cost and time savings for observing
  and estimating crack propagations or other properties of materials.

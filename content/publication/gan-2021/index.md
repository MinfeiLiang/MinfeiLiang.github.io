abstract: <p> This paper presents a method to numerically investigate the microstructural
  effect on the creep behavior of cement paste at the microscale. The lattice fracture
  model is extended to consider local time‐dependent deformations of calcium‐silicate‐hydrate
  phases in the cement paste by imposing local forces. The term “experimentally informed
  model” is used herein as the heterogeneous microstructures of hardened cement pastes
  were obtained by using the X‐ray computed microtomography and directly implemented
  into the model. The mechanical and creep properties of different constituents at
  the resolution of 5 µm were inversely identified from the fracture and creep bending
  tests on cementitious microcantilever beams at the microscale. The model is then
  validated through the comparison with the testing results of cement pastes with
  different <italic>w</italic> / <italic>c</italic> ratios and microstructures. It
  is found that the developed model can successfully reproduce experimentally observed
  behaviors and be applied to explain the experimental results in detail. With the
  method presented in this paper, the relationship between the volume fractions of
  different components and the global creep behavior of cement paste can be established.
  The validation of the model performed at the microscale forms a basis for the multiscale
  analysis of concrete creep. </p>

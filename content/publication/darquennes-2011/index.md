abstract: Under the project \"EcoBéton\" (Green concrete) funded by the French National
  Agency (ANR), concrete mixtures with a high quantity of mineral additions, such
  as blast-furnace slag and fly ash were studied. A first approach to quantify their
  cracking risk was to measure their plastic shrinkage evolution. In parallel, the
  evolution of other parameters such as setting, capillary depression and porosity
  were also monitored to relate this deformation to the evolution of the microstructure
  of the studied mixtures. Setting monitoring by means of ultrasonic measurements
  allows obtaining significant macroscopic information such as hardening process and
  rigidity evolution. The correlation between these different parameters shows that
  the plastic shrinkage evolution can be divided into three phases driven by different
  mechanisms. Moreover, it appears that the use of mineral additions has an effect
  on the plastic shrinkage behaviour, but this impact is not proportional to the percentage
  of additions. It depends on the hydration process and the microstructure of the
  cementitious materials. So, it seems that an optimum content of cement replacement
  by mineral additions must be sought to limit the development of plastic shrinkage
  of concretes with mineral additions at early age. However, a high rate of substitution
  of cement may affect the early age compressive strength of the concrete. So these
  mixtures were also optimised to obtain a significant compressive strength at an
  early age, but this optimisation leads to a higher risk of cracking for some of
  them. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

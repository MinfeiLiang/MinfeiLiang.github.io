abstract: Event-based methods are commonly used to assess the risk to distributed
  infrastructure systems. Stochastic event-based methods consider all hazard scenarios
  that could adversely impact the infrastructure and their associated rates of occurrence.
  However, in many cases, such a comprehensive consideration of the spectrum of possible
  events requires high computational effort. This study presents an active learning
  method for selecting a subset of hazard scenarios for infrastructure risk assessment.
  Active learning enables the efficient training of a Gaussian process predictive
  model by choosing the data from which it learns. The method is illustrated with
  a case study of the Napa water distribution system where a risk-based assessment
  of the post-earthquake functional loss and recovery is performed. A subset of earthquake
  scenarios is sequentially selected using a variance reduction stopping criterion.
  The full probability distribution and annual exceedance curves of the network performance
  metrics are shown to be reasonably estimated.

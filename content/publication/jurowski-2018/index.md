abstract: In this paper, the relationship between the static and dynamic elastic modulus
  of concrete and the relationship between the static elastic modulus and compressive
  strength of concrete have been formulated. These relationships are based on investigations
  of different types of concrete and take into account the type and amount of aggregate
  and binder used. The dynamic elastic modulus of concrete was tested using impulse
  excitation of vibration and the modal analysis method. This method could be used
  as a non-destructive way of estimating the compressive strength of concrete.

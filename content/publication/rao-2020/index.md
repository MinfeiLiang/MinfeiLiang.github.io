abstract: Homogenization is a technique commonly used in multiscale computational
  science and engineering for predicting collective response of heterogeneous materials
  and extracting effective mechanical properties. In this paper, a three-dimensional
  deep convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is proposed to predict the anisotropic
  effective material properties for representative volume elements (RVEs) with random
  inclusions. The high-fidelity dataset generated by a computational homogenization
  approach is used for training the 3D-CNN models. The inference results of the trained
  networks on unseen data indicate that the network is capable of capturing the microstructural
  features of RVEs and produces an accurate prediction of effective stiffness and
  Poisson's ratio. The benefits of the 3D-CNN over conventional finite-element-based
  homogenization with regard to computational efficiency, uncertainty quantification
  and model's transferability are discussed in sequence. We find the salient features
  of the 3D-CNN approach make it a potentially suitable alternative for facilitating
  material design with fast product design iteration and efficient uncertainty quantification.

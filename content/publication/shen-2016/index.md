abstract: High-performance concrete (HPC) is widely used in practice. The water-to-cement
  ratio of HPC is low, and self-desiccation occurs which will induce marked autogenous
  shrinkage. Autogenous shrinkage usually increases the risk of cracking if the concrete
  is restrained from shrinking freely at early age. The autogenous shrinkage and cracking
  resistance of early-age concrete is influenced by curing temperature. However, the
  effect of curing temperature on autogenous shrinkage of early-age concrete is not
  in consistency and how the curing temperature affects the cracking resistance of
  concrete remains lacking. Thus, investigation on the effect of curing temperature
  on cracking resistance of early age concrete must be further studied. In this study,
  experimental studies on early-age cracking of concrete under 100% restraint and
  different curing temperatures were carried out using Temperature Stress Test Machine
  (TSTM). The present study investigated autogenous shrinkage of early-age HPC cured
  at different curing temperatures. The experimental results indicate that (1) the
  ratios of cracking stress to tensile strength for HPC specimens were all lower than
  1.0; (2) the autogenous shrinkage of HPC increased with the increase of curing temperature;
  (3) a prediction model for autogenous shrinkage of HPC was presented considering
  the effect of curing temperature; (4) cracking temperatures and stress reserves
  were selected as the main cracking evaluation indicators of TSTM, and the HPC specimen
  cured at isothermal 20 °C showed better cracking resistance than that at isothermal
  45 °C and adiabatic condition.

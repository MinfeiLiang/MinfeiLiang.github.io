abstract: Statistical nanoindentation technique has been widely used to study the
  microstructural mechanical properties of various types of hardened cement pastes,
  which has significantly improved the fundamental understanding on the mechanical
  performances of concrete and other cementitious composites. However, it was noted
  that the contradictory results from statistical nanoindentation technique appeared
  in the literatures and the critical aspects in the application of this technique
  to hardened cement pastes were recognized. This work is designed to provide an insight
  into the critical aspects, including the influences of material microstructure and
  statistical analysis method. Firstly, the microstructure of hardened cement pastes
  was investigated by SEM-BSE/EDX analysis. Then, the influence of heterogeneous material
  microstructure on the nanoindentation results was investigated through a micromechanical
  method. After that, two general methods of parameter estimation were applied to
  analyze the nanoindentation data and global optimal results were sought by multiple
  runs with the random starting values. This work revealed that the indented 'Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate'
  microstructure is a fact of the composites and the analysis result largely depends
  on the selected statistical analysis method. The influences of material microstructure
  and statistical analysis method may cause unreliable result. In this paper, a method
  for the verification of the result from statistical nanoindentation technique in
  hardened cement pastes was proposed.

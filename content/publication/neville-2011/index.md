abstract: 'Since its first publication in 1963, Properties of Concrete has been internationally
  acclaimed as the definitive work of reference on the subject for both the professional
  and student engineer. The fourth edition has been completely rewritten and updated
  to reflect advances in concrete technology over the past decade, yet it still retains
  the original aim of Professor Nevilles book: to provide reliable, comprehensive
  and practical information on the properties and use of concrete, and the selection
  of mix proportions, all based on scientific observations and the authors extensive
  engineering experience. The emphasis throughout is on understanding the behaviour
  of concrete and relating it to physical and chemical phenomena involved in the performance
  of the material in service. The overall effect is to give an integrated view of
  the properties of concrete so as to enable the reader to achieve the best possible
  construction in concrete. In addition, the scientific basis of the information provided
  is invaluable in planning research and in the interpretation of test results.new
  material includes such topics as various cementitious materials, high performance
  concrete, recently introduced admixtures, concrete under cryogenic conditions, properties
  of the aggregate-matrix interface, and durability of concrete under extreme conditions.incorporates
  a wealth of data from the latest relevant national and international standards and
  codes of practiceboth Sl and Imperial units are used throughoutincludes 1500 full
  references to the worlds literature on concretean extensive index containing over
  6000 entries provides excellent ease-of-reference.\"With its many new additions,
  the book, at 844 pages is now an encyclopaedic tome, which is very reasonably priced.
  It remains the authoritative source of information on most aspects of the constituents,
  behaviour and properties of fresh and hardened concrete.\" Magazine of Concrete

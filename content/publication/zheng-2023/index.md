abstract: <p>The rise of machine learning has fueled the discovery of new materials
  and, especially, metamaterialsâ€”truss lattices being their most prominent class.
  While their tailorable properties have been explored extensively, the design of
  truss-based metamaterials has remained highly limited and often heuristic, due to
  the vast, discrete design space and the lack of a comprehensive parameterization.
  We here present a graph-based deep learning generative framework, which combines
  a variational autoencoder and a property predictor, to construct a reduced, continuous
  latent representation covering an enormous range of trusses. This unified latent
  space allows for the fast generation of new designs through simple operations (e.g.,
  traversing the latent space or interpolating between structures). We further demonstrate
  an optimization framework for the inverse design of trusses with customized mechanical
  properties in both the linear and nonlinear regimes, including designs exhibiting
  exceptionally stiff, auxetic, pentamode-like, and tailored nonlinear behaviors.
  This generative model can predict manufacturable (and counter-intuitive) designs
  with extreme target properties beyond the training domain.</p>

abstract: Currently, there is no reliable approach to quantify the continuous evolution
  of the zero-stress temperature (Tz), despite its well-recognized significance in
  determining the risk of cracking. In this paper, a novel analytical approach is
  proposed to determine the temporal evolution of Tz profiles based on the temperatures
  corresponding to points at which the total stresses are zero. An experimental investigation
  is performed using an advanced Temperature Stress Testing Machine to illustrate
  this approach and an in-depth assessment of Tz is presented. The proposed approach
  allows to determine the continuous Tz profile in concrete subjected to any arbitrary
  temperature profile, compared to existing methods that can identify only discrete
  points. Such obtained Tz profiles tend to establish during the first heat-cool cycle
  within several days after placement and remain essentially constant or even slightly
  increase over time. On that basis, the practical significance and implications of
  such Tz profiles are highlighted.

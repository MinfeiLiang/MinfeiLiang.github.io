 abstract = {Currently, there is no reliable approach to quantify the continuous evolution of the zero-stress temperature (Tz), despite its well-recognized significance in determining the risk of cracking. In this paper, a novel analytical approach is proposed to determine the temporal evolution of Tz profiles based on the temperatures corresponding to points at which the total stresses are zero. An experimental investigation is performed using an advanced Temperature Stress Testing Machine to illustrate this approach and an in-depth assessment of Tz is presented. The proposed approach allows to determine the continuous Tz profile in concrete subjected to any arbitrary temperature profile, compared to existing methods that can identify only discrete points. Such obtained Tz profiles tend to establish during the first heat-cool cycle within several days after placement and remain essentially constant or even slightly increase over time. On that basis, the practical significance and implications of such Tz profiles are highlighted.},

abstract: The macroscopic elastic moduli of two-phase composites are estimated by
  a method that takes account of the inhomogeneity of stress and strain in a way similar
  to the Hershey-Kröner theory of crystalline aggregates. The phases may be arbitrarily
  aeolotropic and in any concentrations, but are required to have the character of
  a matrix and effectively ellipsoidal inclusions. Detailed results arc given for
  an isotropic dispersion of spheres. © 1965.

abstract: Models for restrained strains and self-stresses estimation based on the
  concepts of the conservation law of chemical energy and initial strains calculation
  in the expansive concrete members are considered, together with their advantages
  and disadvantages. A modified strains development model (MSDM) is proposed, based
  on the initial strains calculation approach and extended by taking into account
  cumulative force induced by the reinforcement as an additional restraint for development
  of expansion strains. Validity of the proposed MSDM is confirmed by experimental
  results obtained from tests on uniaxially symmetrically reinforced high expansion
  energy capacity concrete members.

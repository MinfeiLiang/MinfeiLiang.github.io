abstract: Application of micromechanical modelling of hydrated cement paste (HCP)
  gains more and more interests in the field of cementitious materials. One of the
  most promising approaches is the use of so-called microstructure informed micromechanical
  models, which provides a direct link between microstructure and mechanical properties.
  In order to properly model the micromechanical properties of HCP, advanced mechanical
  models, well-characterised microstructures and proper input parameters are required.
  However, due to the complex material structure of HCP, this is not an easy to achieve
  for any of the three aforementioned aspects. Therefore, this paper aims at reviewing
  of the techniques that have been developed to contribute to the micromechanical
  modelling. Basic principles, corresponding research results, recent advances and
  limitations are given. It is expected that this review can help researchers make
  reasonable choices on techniques for the micromechanical modelling of cementitious
  materials.

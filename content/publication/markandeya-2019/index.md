abstract: Metakaolin (MK) is a highly reactive pozzolan obtained from calcining clay
  with high kaolinite content at elevated temperatures (650 to 800Â°C). Its use at
  replacement levels between 5 and 20% enhances concrete properties such as high early-
  and later-age strength and lowers the diffusion coefficient due to pore size refinement.
  However, early-age cracking due to higher temperature rise and autogenous shrinkage
  is a concern. This study reports on the effect of the inclusion of prewetted lightweight
  aggregates (LWAs) on early-age cracking under semi-adiabatic conditions and uniaxial
  restraint using a rigid cracking frame. Lower cracking tendency is reported based
  on the tensile stress-strength ratio and cracking temperature. The chemical shrinkage
  coefficient for MK is determined using shrinkage measurements and thermodynamic
  modeling (GEMS). These findings can be used to determine appropriate LWA replacement
  levels in MK-blended concrete mixtures to minimize shrinkage and cracking potential.

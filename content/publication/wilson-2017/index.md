abstract: Although concrete sustainability can be remarkably improved by replacing
  high amounts of Portland cement clinker with supplementary cementitious materials
  (SCMs), this approach is far from being fully exploited. To compete with conventional
  concrete, a better understanding of low-cement concrete is needed regarding both
  microstructural features responsible for mechanical performance and key parameters
  for robust mix design. In particular, this paper aims at disclosing the microstructure
  of cementitious systems in which up to 60% of Portland cement has been replaced
  with natural pozzolan (NP), without significantly affecting the 90-day mechanical
  strength and stiffness (using a fixed water-to-binder ratio of 0.35). The study
  carries out coupled nanoindentation/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses,
  micromechanics modelling and image analysis to disclose the mechanical effects of
  NP on the overall stiffness and strength (i.e., the formation of a micro-granular
  skeleton of hard anhydrous inclusions and the transformation of Portlandite into
  calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate [C-A-S-H]).

abstract: Many scientific and engineering investigations require the extraction of
  the first derivative from experimental data. Direct numerical differentiation is
  usually impractical because this amplifies the noise in the data, leading to unreliable
  results. This investigation shows that the problem of differentiating experimental
  data can be converted into one of solving an integral equation of the first kind.
  Tikhonov regularization is used to solve this integral equation, leading to a smooth
  first derivative. By using the built-in regularization parameter in the method noise
  amplification is kept under control. The performance of this method is demonstrated
  by applying it to data taken from the literature. Â© 2005 American Institute of Chemical

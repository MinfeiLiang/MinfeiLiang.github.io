abstract: Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) is widely considered to be a sustainable
  alternative to Portland cement concrete. However, on account of extensive heterogeneity
  in composition of the aluminosilicates, coupled with the failure of classical materials
  science approaches to unravel the underlying composition-property linkages, reliable
  prediction of AAC's properties has remained infeasible. This paper presents a random
  forest (RF) model to predict two properties of fly ash-based AACs that are important
  from compliance standpoint – slump flow; and compressive strength – in relation
  to physiochemical attributes, curing conditions, and mixing procedures of the concretes.
  Results show that the RF model – once meticulously trained, and after its hyperparameters
  are rigorously optimized – is able to produce high fidelity predictions of both
  properties of new AACs. The model is also used to quantitatively assess the influence
  of physiochemical attributes and process parameters on the AAC's properties. Outcomes
  of this work present a pathway to optimization of AACs' properties.

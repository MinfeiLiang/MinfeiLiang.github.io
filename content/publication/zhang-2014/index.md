abstract: This study is dedicated to comparing minutes-long microindentation creep
  experiments on cement paste with years-long macroscopic creep experiments on concrete
  and months-long macroscopic creep experiments on cement paste. For all experiments,
  after a transient period the creep function was well captured by a logarithmic function
  of time, the amplitude of which is governed by a so-called creep modulus. The non-logarithmic
  transient periods lasted for days at the macroscopic scale, but only for seconds
  at the scale of microindentation. The creep moduli (which thus govern the rate of
  the long-term logarithmic creep) of concrete samples were estimated from microindentations
  performed at the scale of cement pastes in combination with micro-mechanical models.
  Those estimates were proportional to the creep moduli measured on concrete samples
  by regular macroscopic uniaxial testing, thus proving that minutes-long microindentation
  can provide a measurement of the long-term creep properties of cementitious materials.

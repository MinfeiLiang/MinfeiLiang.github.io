abstract: Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor
  and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the
  versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting
  a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the
  learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data
  sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression
  show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the
  instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant
  changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. Â© 1996

abstract: This paper provides a systematic literature review, based on the identification,
  appraisal, selection and synthesis of publications relating to the effect of incorporating
  recycled aggregates sourced from construction and demolition wastes, on the creep
  behaviour of concrete. It identifies various influencing aspects related to the
  use of recycled aggregates such as replacement level, size and origin, as well as
  mixing procedure, exposure to different environmental conditions, use of chemical
  admixtures and additions, and creep of recycled aggregate concrete after unloading.
  A statistical analysis on the collated data is also presented with the purpose of
  understanding the creep behaviour of concrete, based on the replacement level of
  recycled aggregates. The evidence gathered was also compared to a model for compliance
  prediction. Correction factors of the creep coefficient of concrete with varying
  recycled aggregate content are presented in this paper. Some of the prediction models
  are feasible for use in recycled aggregate concrete.

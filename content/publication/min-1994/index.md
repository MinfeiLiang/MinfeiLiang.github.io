abstract: The formation and expansion of ettringite crystals are discussed on the
  basis of principles of physico-chemistry. It is suggested that ettringite forms
  by a through-solution mechanism and that expansive force results from crystallization
  pressure as well as swelling pressure converted from the reduction of chemical potentials
  in the reaction of ettringite formation. Expansion depends mainly on the positions
  where ettringite crystals form. In a pore solution of high alkalinity, ettringite
  crystals form in situ and cause a large expansion. Alternately, they precipitate
  partially or completely in voids, thus giving rise to a little expansion or no expansion.

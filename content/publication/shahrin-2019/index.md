abstract: "The compressive strength and failure of concrete and cement exhibit strong
  size effect over various length scales. To investigate possible size effect on compressive
  strength and failure mechanism of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates (C-S-H) in cement paste,
  micropillar compression experiments were performed on micropillar geometries fabricated
  by focused ion beam milling on potential C-S-H locations identified through coupled
  backscatter electron imaging (BSE) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis.
  The compressive strength of C-S-H (181â€“1145 MPa) measured from C-S-H micropillars
  of varying diameters indicated presence of a size effect with strong increase in
  strength with decreasing diameter. The deformation mode at failure also exhibited
  size effect: the dominant failure mode changed from axial splitting to plastic crushing
  as the pillar diameter was decreased. The observed relationship between strength
  and pillar diameter can be modeled by an inverse square root dependency which closely
  corresponds to Bazant's scaling law of quasi-brittle failure."

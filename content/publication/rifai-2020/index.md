abstract: 'Alkali-activated slag (AAS) binders show in general larger autogeneous
  shrinkage strains than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based binders. However, AAS
  can be a relevant alternative to OPC, if, for example low hydration heat release
  and fine pores, are required. This study proposes an evaluation of the advantage
  of using AAS materials in small-sized or massive structures with regard to cracking
  risk by autogeneous shrinkage and thermal strains. A cracking risk index is calculated;
  this risk is defined as the ratio between stress generated by full restraint and
  tensile strength. All required experimental data were investigated in an OPC and
  AAS mortar, these are: heat release, autogeneous shrinkage, Youngâ€™s modulus, tensile
  strength and basic creep evolutions. The material parameters of a rate-dependent
  model developed in 1D were then identified. Numerical simulations were then performed
  for different thicknesses in full-restraint conditions. These show that, as expected,
  basic creep is a very important material parameter to assess. Indeed, basic creep
  enables the significant reduction of the generated stresses. Besides, it is found
  that the more the structure is large (and sensitive to cracking by risk by thermal
  strain), the more the AAS material is becoming appropriate compared to the OPC material.'

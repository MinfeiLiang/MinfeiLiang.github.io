abstract: The use of statistical and machine learning approaches to predict the compressive
  strength of concrete based on mixture proportions, on account of its industrial
  importance, has received significant attention. However, previous studies have been
  limited to small, laboratory-produced data sets. This study presents the first analysis
  of a large data set (>10,000 observations) of measured compressive strengths from
  actual (job-site) mixtures and their corresponding actual mixture proportions. Predictive
  models are applied to examine relationships between the mixture design variables
  and strength, and to thereby develop an estimate of the (28-day) strength. These
  models are also applied to a laboratory-based data set of strength measurements
  published by Yeh et al. (1998) and the performance of the models across both data
  sets is compared. Furthermore, to illustrate the value of such models beyond simply
  strength prediction, they are used to design optimal concrete mixtures that minimize
  cost and embodied CO2 impact while satisfying imposed target strengths.
